// ColorSet groups the per-state colors of an interactive widget into
// one value, so a caller who wants a single consistent appearance says
// it once instead of assigning five or six flat Color* fields.
//
// Seventeen widgets carry it: Button, Switch, Toggle, Radio, DatePicker,
// InputDate (flat state fields deleted), and Input, NumericInput, Select,
// Combobox, ListBox, Tree, Slider, ContextMenu, Menubar, Table,
// ExpandPanel (flat fields retained and winning over the set; see
// applyTo).
//
// Zero value is "nothing specified": every field falls back, and a
// ColorSet a caller never touches changes nothing.
//
// Why plain Color and not Opt[Color]: Color already carries its own
// set flag (see Color.IsSet), and ColorTransparent is an explicitly-set
// fully-transparent color, so "unset" and "deliberately transparent"
// are already distinguishable without a wrapper. Wrapping would give
// the type two independent notions of unset — Some(Color{}) would mean
// "set to unset" — and every existing widget already branches on
// Color.IsSet.
type ColorSet struct {
	// Base is the resting background color. It is also the fallback
	// for Hover, Click and Focus when those are unset.
	Base Color

	// Hover, Click and Focus are the background colors for the three
	// interactive states. Unset means "same as Base".
	Hover Color
	Click Color
	Focus Color

	// Border is the border color. It does NOT fall back to Base —
	// a border the same color as the fill reads as no border at all,
	// which is not what omitting the field should mean. Unset falls
	// through to the theme.
	Border Color

	// BorderFocus is the border color while keyboard-focused. Unset
	// falls back to Border, then to the theme.
	BorderFocus Color
}

// Flat returns a ColorSet whose every field is c, including the two
// border fields. This is the "do not react" case: a widget that keeps
// one appearance through hover, press and focus.
//
// Flat is not the same as ColorSet{Base: c}. Base only backs the three
// interactive states; Flat also pins the borders, which is what makes
// the widget visually inert rather than merely uniform in its fill.

// Colors.Base for the same migration reason applyTo encodes — code
// that set Color keeps its appearance when a ColorSet arrives.

	// stop reacting to the pointer and to focus. That is a behavior
	// change, not a refactor, and Flat(c) is how a caller asks for it
	// deliberately.

//
// That ordering is the precedence rule, and it is deliberately the
// unintuitive direction: a flat field that the caller assigned wins
// over the ColorSet. The reason is migration safety. Existing code
// assigns flat fields; when a ColorSet arrives — from a preset, a
// shared style value, or a half-finished edit — that code must keep
// the appearance it has today rather than silently changing color.
// The newer, more specific-looking API is the one that yields.
//
// Fields left unset by both are untouched, so the caller's theme
// defaults still apply afterwards.
// Written as straight-line assignments rather than a table because
// this runs once per styled widget per frame, and the table form puts
// a composite literal on the view path for no readability gain.
