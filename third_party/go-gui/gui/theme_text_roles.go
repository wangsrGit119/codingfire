// Named text roles.
//
// De-emphasized text used to be spelled as a literal alpha at each call
// site: seven distinct values covering four semantic roles, in three
// different notations, with the same "disabled text" state rendering at
// 65, 127 and 130 depending on the widget (issue #335; measurements in
// docs/specs/widget-visual-consistency-audit.md).
//
// A role names the *reason* text is quiet. A widget asks for the role;
// the theme decides what that looks like. Adding a literal alpha at a
// call site is the thing this replaces — if none of the four roles fits,
// the answer is a fifth role, not a local number.
//
//	TextStyleSecondary   supporting text beside primary text
//	TextStyleLabel       text naming a nearby value; the value is read
//	TextStyleDisabled    text in a control the user cannot act on
//	TextStylePlaceholder text standing in for a value not yet entered
//
// Roles are per-theme values, not one multiplier applied everywhere. See
// textRolesFor for why that distinction is load-bearing.

// textRoleAlphas is one theme's de-emphasis ladder, as alpha applied to
// the theme's own text color.
type textRoleAlphas struct {
	placeholder uint8

// The two ladders are contrast-matched, not equal.
//
// Alpha blends text toward the background, and that is not perceptually
// symmetric between a dark and a light ground. Recorded from the render
// pipeline, every de-emphasis alpha in the package today is byte
// identical across ThemeDark and ThemeLight — which means the light
// theme has been running at materially lower contrast for every quiet
// role. Worked example, disabled text at alpha 128:
//
//	dark   225 over 48   -> #898989 on #303030, contrast 3.77
//	light   32 over 225  -> #808080 on #e1e1e1, contrast 3.11
//
// textRolesOnLight is the dark ladder solved back through the sRGB
// luminance curve to land on the *same* contrast ratio against a light
// ground. So a role means the same amount of de-emphasis in either
// theme, which is what lets a widget name a role and stop thinking.

// disabledTextColor is the color disabled text takes when its own base

// Unexported on purpose. The role reaches downstream widgets without
// this seam: they build Shapes, layoutDisables stamps the state, and
// renderText asks the theme for them — so a caller outside gui/ has
// nothing to ask. Export it when something outside the shape pipeline
// needs the amount, not before.
//
// The amount is the theme's decision — per-theme and contrast-matched
// (see textRolesFor) — so a caller never spells it. The renderer asks
// this question for text shapes stamped Disabled, which is how a
// widget that never themed its disabled text still lands on the role
// instead of dimAlpha's theme-blind halving (issue #341). Factories
// composing the same state at generation time use withRoleAlpha with
// TextStyleDisabled, which also carries the disabledRole marker this
// color answer cannot.
//
// base's own alpha is deliberately discarded, not multiplied: the role
// is an absolute amount of de-emphasis, and one disabled control reads
// as one amount of dead — a translucent base is therefore raised to the
// role, not quieted twice. The consequence to know about is at the
// renderText call site, where a shape's Opacity has already been folded
// into base: a disabled text shape ignores its Opacity. Fade a disabled
// text shape by animating the color itself, or by fading a parent whose
