// Dev-mode diagnostics.
//
// A family of defects in this library are silent by construction: a
// focusable widget without an ID renders and clicks but never joins
// the tab order, a scrollable widget without an ID shares the key ""
// with every other ID-less scrollable in the window, an OnMouseLeave
// on an ID-less shape never fires, and a duplicate ID collapses two
// widgets onto one identity. None of these produce an error, a panic,
// or a visual difference.
//
// The debug gate turns them into messages on stderr. It is off by
// default and costs one atomic load per frame when off.
//
// The duplicate check is strict: no shape may claim an ID another
// shape already claimed, ancestor or not. A composite widget whose
// inner shape needs the owning widget's focus or state references it
// through Shape.focusOwner rather than repeating its ID, which keeps
// "one ID, one widget" true and keeps this check meaningful.

// debugMask gates every check in this file, one bit per
// [DebugCategory]. It is an atomic.Uint32 rather than a plain value
// because [Debug] and [DebugCategories] make it mutable at runtime,
// and the checks read it from the frame goroutine while an
// application may flip it from another. Load compiles to a plain
// load on amd64 and arm64, so the mutability is the reason, not the
// lookup cost.

// debugGen increments on every false -> true transition of the gate.

	// Advisory, not a defect: a top-level widget legitimately has no

	DebugUnscopedIDs

	// DebugUnresolvedKeys reports per-widget state stored under a leaf
	// ID that an ancestor join rewrote, so the widget's state key and
	// its shape's identity are different strings.
	//
	// A factory that closes over the raw cfg.ID and keys StateMap on it
	// works while the widget sits at the top level, where the scope is
	// empty and the leaf is already the identity. Put the same widget
	// under an ID-bearing ancestor and its shape resolves to
	// "panel:leaf" while its state still lives at "leaf". Nothing
	// panics and nothing looks wrong; the widget stops responding. The
	// two EffID seams exist to prevent this, and neither is required by
	// the compiler.
	//
	// The finding is raised when a state key names no shape in the
	// window and an ancestor join rewrote a shape of that leaf, which
	// is the signature of a missed resolve rather than of an unrelated
	// key that happens to collide.
	//
	// The finding is latent rather than immediate — a widget that keys
	// both the write and the read on the same unresolved leaf works,
	// and fails only when a second instance of it appears under a
	// different scope with the same cfg.ID — but it is a defect either
	// way, so [Debug] turns it on.
	// exportaudit:keep — dev-diagnostic API for app authors
	DebugUnresolvedKeys

	// DebugUnknownFocus reports a window whose focus ID names no
	// focusable shape in the frame, so the keyboard has nowhere to go.
	//
	// [Window.SetFocus] takes the *effective* ID and accepts any
	// string. A leaf spelled without the scope its widget sits under —
	// "nav" where the frame stamped "detail:nav" — is accepted, stored
	// and never matched, which is the same silent shape the resolve
	// checks report from the other side.
	//
	// The check runs from the frame audit rather than from SetFocus,
	// because setting focus on a widget the current frame has not built
	// yet is legitimate and common: a view function may focus a control
	// it is in the middle of returning. Only a frame that finished with
	// nothing focusable under that name is a finding.
	//
	// It also fires when the focused widget leaves the tree — a tab
	// switch, a closed dialog — which is a real dangling focus rather
	// than a false alarm: the keyboard is dead until something takes
	// focus back. [Window.ClearFocus] is how a view drops it on purpose.
	// exportaudit:keep — dev-diagnostic API for app authors
	DebugUnknownFocus

	// DebugStampDrift reports a shape whose effective ID is not the one
	// its position in the tree calls for: either it disagrees with the
	// scope the shape was arranged under, or an ID-bearing shape has no
	// stamp at all.
	//
	// Identity is stamped once, during layout generation, by
	// generateViewLayout and appendChildViews. A shape that never went
	// through either — a hand-built Layout spliced into a generated
	// tree — carries no stamp, and every store then keys it on its bare
	// leaf, which works until a second widget of that leaf appears
	// somewhere else in the window.
	//
	// This is the check that keeps the single stamping rule honest, so
	// [Debug] turns it on.
	// exportaudit:keep — dev-diagnostic API for app authors
	DebugStampDrift

	// DebugUnknownLookup reports an ID lookup that found nothing while
	// the frame stamped the same leaf under a scope, so the caller
	// spelled a leaf where an effective ID was wanted.
	//
	// [Layout.FindByID], [Window.ScrollVerticalTo] and
	// [Window.ScrollVerticalToPct] all take the *effective* ID and all
	// answer a wrong spelling by doing nothing: FindByID returns
	// (nil, false) into the caller's usual `if !ok { return }`, and the
	// scroll calls store an offset no scrollable ever reads. The
	// failure is latent — a leaf is the identity at the top level, so
	// the call works until the widget is dropped under a panel with an
	// ID, and then the feature stops with no output.
	//
	// The finding is raised only when the frame stamped an identity
	// whose last segment is the leaf that was asked for, which is the
	// signature of a missed scope rather than of a lookup for something
	// that is simply not rendered. Probing for a widget that may or may
	// not be in the frame is a legitimate pattern — rtfResolveAnchor
	// does it — and stays silent, as does a lookup made before the
	// first frame is laid out.
	//
	// Warn-once memory for this category is package-level rather than
	// per-window: [Layout.FindByID] is reached from a Layout, which
	// does not name the window that stamped it. A finding is therefore
	// reported once per process per (call, id) pair, and is asserted
	// through the debug output rather than through
	// [Window.TestFindings].
	// exportaudit:keep — dev-diagnostic API for app authors
	DebugUnknownLookup

	// DebugGlyphLayoutFallback reports a text shape the glyph shaper
	// refused — past its byte budget, for example — so the frame fell
	// back to approximate metrics. Caret placement, selection
	// rectangles and grapheme-aware delete all lose precision past
	// that point, silently without this finding: nothing errors, the
	// text still renders, only the boundaries drift.
	// exportaudit:keep — dev-diagnostic API for app authors
	DebugGlyphLayoutFallback

	// DebugSizing reports sizing config the layout pass silently
	// ignores: a Fixed axis that also states Min or Max. Fixed pins
	// Min = Max = size (applyFixedSizingConstraints), so the stated
	// bounds never take effect. A redundant bound equal to the size
	// stays quiet; only a conflicting one reports.
	// exportaudit:keep — dev-diagnostic API for app authors
	DebugSizing

	// DebugLayoutInvariants reports a frame whose arranged tree breaks a
	// sizing rule: a child outside its parent's bounds where the parent
	// neither clips nor scrolls, a minimum left above its maximum, or a
	// non-finite or negative size. The rules are
	// docs/specs/layout-sizing-rules.md; the checks are
