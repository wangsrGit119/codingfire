// Dev-mode audit for per-widget state stored under an unresolved ID.
//
// Every other identity mistake in this library has a gate: a duplicate
// effective ID, a focusable or scrollable shape with no ID, and
// hand-rolled ID composition are all reported. A state key that was
// never resolved is the one that was not, and it is the quietest of
// them: the widget renders, the state is written, and the read never
// sees it.
//
// The audit does not instrument the store. It runs once per frame from
// debugAudit, over the identities the layout walk already collected,
// and compares them with the keys the string-keyed state maps hold.

// stringKeyed is the seam onto a BoundedMap whose keys are strings.
// The registry stores maps boxed in `any` with the key type erased, so
// the audit asks through this interface rather than knowing K; a map
// keyed by anything else answers nil.

// debugCheckStateKeys reports a state key that is a bare leaf while
// the shape of that name resolved under a scope.
//
// A key is a finding when all three hold:
//
//   - it is a bare leaf: non-empty and free of IDSep, so it was never
//     joined to a scope and is not absolute;
//   - no shape in the window carries it as an identity, so it is not
//     the legitimate key of an unscoped top-level widget;
//   - an ancestor join rewrote a shape of that leaf, which is the
//     shape whose state this key was meant to be.
//
// The third condition is what keeps the audit quiet. It reads
// debugIDs.scoped, which holds only the leaves an ancestor join
// actually rewrote, so a widget that builds its own absolute ID —
// Form composes "form:login" from cfg.ID "login" — is absent from the
// index and keys its state on cfg.ID without a finding. A cache keyed
// by a file name or a URL satisfies the first two conditions and is
// reported only if a widget in the same window resolved from that
// exact leaf.
