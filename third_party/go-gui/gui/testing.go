// This file is the app-testing API (developer-ergonomics spec §4.6).
//
// Why it lives in package gui rather than a gui/guitest subpackage:
// driving a click means reaching Shape.events, which is unexported and
// should stay that way. A sibling package could only get there if the
// field were exported permanently, for the benefit of tests, on the
// single hottest struct in the library. §9 Q1 resolved this as
// "package gui".
//
// Why these drive Window.EventFn rather than calling the callback
// directly: the callback is the easy half. The interesting failures are
// in the other half — the widget never joined focus traversal, an
// overlay swallowed the click, the container clamped the scroll offset.
// Synthesizing an Event and pushing it through real dispatch exercises
// all of that; reaching into Shape.events would test only the part that
// was never broken.
//
// Targeting is by ID (§9 Q2). A coordinate-based TestClickAt is a
// separate future name, not an overload of these.

// Errors reported by the Test* methods. All are returned wrapped with
// the offending ID, so callers should match with errors.Is.
