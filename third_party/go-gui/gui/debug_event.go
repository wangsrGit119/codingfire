// Unconsumed-event check.
//
// §4.3b of docs/specs/developer-ergonomics.md deleted the
// consume/notify split in v0.55.0: one rule, nothing is pre-marked,
// every callback consumes explicitly. The compile-time half of that
// change was loud — ctx.Bubble() disappeared and its call sites stopped
// building. This check covers the other half, which is silent: a
// callback that acts on an event and forgets to consume it lets that
// event carry on to an ancestor. No compile error, no panic, just a
// click that fires twice.
//
// Reading the source cannot answer it. Whether an unconsumed event
// reaches a second handler is a property of the layout tree at dispatch
// time, so the check is evaluated where the answer is knowable: right
// after a callback returns, ask whether the event is still unhandled
// and whether an ancestor would receive it. Both true is a double
// dispatch.
//
// The one false positive to know about is deliberate pass-through — a
// handler that inspects an event, decides it is not its own, and leaves
// it alone. That is now the ordinary way to decline, and it is
// indistinguishable from forgetting. Findings are a list to read, not
// a list of bugs.
//
// Turn it on with gui.Debug(true) or GOGUI_DEBUG=1, exercise the app,
// and read the findings off stderr. Each is reported once per window.
// [DebugCategories] can enable this check without the frame audits.

// debugUnconsumed reports one dispatch where a callback acted on an
// event, did not consume it, and an ancestor will therefore also
// receive it.
//
// Called from callRelative, executeFocusCallback and the gesture
// dispatch after every named callback.
//
// No-op unless the unconsumed category is on, which is one atomic load.
