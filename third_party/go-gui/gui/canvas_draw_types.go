// which is always centered on the quad with radius max(W,H)/2, lands

// DrawCanvasTriBatch is one triangle batch.
//
// A flat batch leaves VertexColors nil and paints every triangle in
// Color. A gradient batch carries one color per vertex — exactly
// len(Triangles)/2 of them — which every backend already consumes
// through RenderCmd.VertexColors; its Color is then the gradient
// sampled at its midpoint, kept only so a flat-only consumer degrades
// to something reasonable rather than to nothing.
//
// The two never mix inside one batch: a gradient fill always starts a
// fresh batch, so the length relation above holds per batch and
// validSvgCmd can enforce it.
//
// Lifetime: both slices belong to the canvas's cache entry and are
// recycled by its next redraw (DrawContext.resetFor). A consumer that
// keeps a RenderCmd past the frame it was emitted in — the print export
// is the one in-tree case — must copy the geometry out first.
//
// A batch also carries the canvas transform in force when it was
// recorded (issue #474). Geometry is stored in the local coordinates
// the caller drew in; the matrix rides on the RenderCmd, where every
// backend already applies it per vertex. hasXform is what makes the
// zero value an untransformed batch — the identity is {1,1,0,0}, not
// the zero canvasXform.

// The background opacity recorded with the entry modulates BgColor's
// alpha; it has no effect when BgColor is unset. It is set through
// DrawContext.Image's bgOpacity parameter and is not an exported field.

// The entry's fetcher, when non-nil, overrides WindowCfg.ImageFetcher
// for this entry's http/https download. It is set through
// DrawContext.ImageWithFetcher, likewise not an exported field. Typical use is map-tile rendering
// where each tile source wants its own User-Agent. Known limit:
// downloads are URL-keyed and deduped process-wide, so the first
// entry observed for a given URL binds the fetcher for that URL's
// in-flight download. Consumers wiring two fetchers to overlapping
// URL namespaces must route via URL prefix themselves.
//
// ClipX/ClipY/ClipW/ClipH restrict drawing to a sub-rectangle of the
// canvas, in the same content-relative coordinates as X/Y/W/H. They
// are honored only when Clipped is set (a zero rect would otherwise
// be indistinguishable from "no clip"). Use it to show part of an
// image without cropping the file: the texture still maps to the
// full X/Y/W/H rect, the scissor decides what is visible.

// caller's own slice is passed straight through and would be safe to

// satisfies it is correct either way, rather than correct until the
