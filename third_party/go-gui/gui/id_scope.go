// IDSep separates the segments of a composed widget ID.
//
// A widget ID is a colon-joined path: the owning widget's ID, then the
// segments that distinguish one inner shape from another. Colon was
// chosen because it was already the dominant separator in the codebase
// and is rare in application-supplied IDs, which favour "-" and "_".
const IDSep = ":"

// ScopeID composes an inner widget's ID from the owning widget's ID and
// one or more parts.
//
// IDs stay flat, window-global strings: the result is the whole
// identity, and it is what SetFocus, ScrollVerticalTo, FindByID and the
// test helpers take. The owner may itself be a composed ID, which is
// how a scope nests:
//
//	base := ScopeID(cfg.ID, "header", col.ID) // "grid:header:name"
//	ScopeID(base, "resize")                   // "grid:header:name:resize"
//
// Parts must not contain IDSep. Nothing enforces that at runtime:
// ScopeID runs in the per-widget view phase, so a per-part scan would
// tax every frame, and there is no reporting channel — no *Window —
// to say where the stray separator came from. Collisions are already
// reported by gui.Debug and asserted by (*Window).TestDuplicateIDs.
// The one harm a collision check cannot catch is a consumer that
// parses an ID back apart: dataGridHeaderColIDFromLayoutID recovers a
// column by trimming the grid prefix, so a separator inside a data key
// mis-attributes the column without any duplicate. Keep data-derived
// keys separator-free, or key them positionally with ScopeIDN. A leaf
// value derived from data — a row key, a heading slug — is a part,
// not a scope, and keeps whatever spelling its own producer uses.
//
// Empty segments are dropped, so no leading or doubled separator
// appears. An empty owner is therefore not an error: an ID-less
// composite still produces workable inner IDs, and two of them in one
// window collide loudly rather than silently.
//
// Costs exactly one allocation: the returned string. parts does not
// escape, so the variadic backing array stays on the caller's stack.
