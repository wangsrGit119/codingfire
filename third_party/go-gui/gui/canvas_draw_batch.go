// canvas_draw_batch.go — batch allocation and context lifetime for
// DrawCanvas.
//
// A DrawContext is rebuilt for every redraw of every canvas, and an
// animated canvas redraws every frame. Nothing here changes what is
// tessellated; it decides where the tessellation lands, so that the
// second and later redraws of the same canvas write into the buffers
// the previous one left behind instead of allocating a new set.

// defaultBatchVerts is the vertex count a flat batch reserves for,
// matching the cap 128 the pre-pool code allocated.
const defaultBatchVerts = 64

// takeBatch appends a batch and gives it the buffers the previous
// redraw's batch at the same index left behind.
//
// Index alignment is what makes this work: one canvas emits its
// primitives in the same order every frame, so batch i is nearly always
// the same batch it was last time and its buffers are already the right
// size. When the order does shift the only cost is a resize.
//
// Ownership stays single. The pool is the outgoing cache entry, which
// renderDrawCanvas discards once the redraw returns, so a buffer that
// is claimed here has exactly one live referent afterwards.
//
// numVerts sizes a fresh allocation when nothing is poolable; gradient
// batches also claim a VertexColors buffer, flat ones leave it nil so
// they stay distinguishable from a gradient batch carrying no colors.

// Batches are pooled rather than overwritten: prev.Batches still holds
// the buffers the last redraw filled, which takeBatch claims one by
// one, while the writing happens in prev.spare. The two arrays swap
// roles every redraw. Texts and Images need no such care — nothing
// downstream keeps a reference into those arrays past the frame that
// emitted them, so the arrays are simply refilled.
//
// Those buffers are aliased by the previous frame's RenderCmds, which
// is safe because the frame loop is single-threaded and buildRenderers
// has already dropped that command list before this runs. See the note
// on DrawCanvasTriBatch about export paths that copy commands out.
