// These do not run from the per-frame audit like the rest of gui/debug.go:
// a backend calls them at window creation or from a window setter, where
// the platform's answer is known. Both report through
// DebugWindowDegraded, and both take reason as the warn-once
// discriminator, so two causes that hold at once are reported separately.

// DebugWindowTransparency reports that WindowCfg.Transparent did not
// take effect, and why. Called by a backend at window creation, where
// the platform answer is known and the app author's only clue would
// otherwise be a window that looks wrong. reason is the warn-once
// discriminator, so each distinct cause is reported once.
