// EventCtx bundles the three values every input-event callback needs.
// Passed by value. It is three pointers (24 bytes), so Go's register
// ABI passes it in registers with no heap allocation even through an
// indirect call. Methods use value receivers and mutate through the
// Event pointer, so they match the alloc story and avoid addressability
// footguns on non-addressable EventCtx values.
//
// Value semantics also make nested (reentrant) dispatch safe: each
// callback frame owns its own copy, so an OnClick that synchronously
// triggers OnScroll cannot have its context corrupted by the inner
// frame.

// Consume marks the event handled so ancestors do not receive it.
//
// One rule, every event: a callback that acts on an event says so. No
// event is marked handled on a callback's behalf, so a callback that
// does not call Consume lets the event travel on. This holds for every
// callback — OnClick and OnChar no differently from OnKeyDown and
// OnHover.

// EffID resolves a leaf ID a handler closed over to the effective ID
// the framework's stores are keyed by (see gui/id_resolve.go).
//
// This is not "resolve my own ID", and there is no argument-free form of it.
// The leaf names a shape at or above the handler, and the handler's own shape
// frequently carries no ID at all: Input attaches its click handler to an
// ID-less inner row and resolves the leaf of the outer container, and a
// scrollbar resolves the leaf of the scrollable ancestor it drives. Reading an
// identity off ctx.Layout would answer "" in both cases, so the argument is
// load-bearing (issue #526).
//
// A widget factory that builds its tree eagerly — Input, for one — has
// no Window when it captures cfg.ID, so it cannot call
// [Window.EffID] at generation time. Its handlers resolve here instead:
// the leaf names this shape or one of its ancestors, and by the time an
// event is dispatched every shape carries its resolved identity.
//
// An absolute leaf (one containing IDSep) and a leaf naming nothing in
// the ancestor chain both resolve exactly as the resolve pass would
// resolve them in this position.

// It no longer carries a dispatch rule. Until v0.55.0 there were two
// classes — consume-class events were marked handled before the
// callback ran, notify-class events were not — and the difference was
// invisible in a callback's signature, so which one you had written was
// something you had to know rather than something you could see. That
// split is gone: nothing is pre-marked and every callback consumes
// explicitly.
//
// What remains is the name, which the unconsumed-event debug check
// (debug_event.go) needs: "would an ancestor also have received this?"
// is a per-event question, meaning OnClick on a containing shape for
// evClick and the focused target's OnChar for evChar.
//
// The classification is internal: it is encoded at the dispatch sites
// and is neither exposed nor configurable.
