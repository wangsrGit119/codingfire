// Focus appearance for container-shaped widgets.
//
// Button reaches its focus colors through shapeButtonColors and
// buttonAmendLayout. Everything else that is focusable but not a button
// — Select, ListBox, Table — has to restyle its own shape once focus
// lands on it, because focus is resolved after layout and the shape is
// already built by then.
//
// That was open-coded per widget, which is why ListBox and Table simply
// had no focus ring: nothing forced the question at the point a widget
// was written (issue #335, audit section 6). One helper makes the
// convention reachable, so a new focusable container gets a ring by
// asking for one rather than by remembering the mechanism.

// focusRingBorderWidth is the stroke width of the keyboard-focus ring
// a container paints on its border.
//
// It is a const, never a theme's SizeBorder: a borderless theme sets
// that to 0 (ThemeLight does, issue #390), and the keyboard cursor
// has to be visible in every theme.
const focusRingBorderWidth = 1

// focusRingBorderAmend returns the AmendLayout hook that strokes a
// focus ring — SizeBorder + ColorBorder — on the shape that currently
// holds key.
//
// Key is an effective ID, tested via IsFocus. It may be a foreign ID:
// a list row has no identity of its own, so its ring tests the owning
// list's key; the color swatch's ring lives on its color layer, so it
// captures the control's effective ID at generation instead.
//
// The ring is applied from AmendLayout, never from the Cfg: a border in
// the config insets content and would shift what the ring is meant to
// outline (the plane's gradient would move 1px off its marker
// positions). AmendLayout runs after arrange, so a ring set there
// strokes the edge without moving anything inside it.
//
// Returns nil when there is nothing to paint — no key, no width, no
// color — so a caller that cannot hold focus pays no closure. A
// disabled shape never shows focus: it cannot hold it, and the dimmed
// fill already reads as inert.

// colorControlFocusRing fills in the focus ring for a color-picker
// control — the plane, wheel, channel slider and swatch.
//
// All four are focusable and draggable and drew no focus indication of
// any kind, so a keyboard user had no way to tell which one they were
// on (issue #335, audit section 6). They are also the awkward case: a
// gradient surface cannot tint on hover or focus the way a button fill
// can, because the fill *is* the value being edited. The ring goes on
// the border instead, via focusRingBorderAmend.
//
// A theme that never decided a focus colour yields a nil hook, which
// amendAll drops — the control's own AmendLayout survives untouched.

// applyFocusRingShadow hangs the theme's focus ring on a shape that

//
// The ring is a zero-offset tinted shadow rather than a border: macOS
// draws focus as a soft glow *outside* the control, and a border insets
// content, which would shift a control's interior the moment it took
// focus. renderContainer emits the shadow before the fill, so the glow
// sits behind the control rather than over it.
//
// Allocating here, rather than reserving a shapeEffects at generation
// for every focusable widget, means only the one focused shape in the
// window pays. The pool hands out individually allocated objects and
// grows a slice of pointers, so a pointer taken here stays valid even
// if the pool grows again later in the frame; it is invalidated only by
// the next view-phase reset, which is also when the shape itself dies.
//
// ring is theme-owned and shared by every shape in the window — assign
// it, never write through it.
