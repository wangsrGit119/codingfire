// Dev-mode diagnostic for an ID lookup that missed.
//
// The addressing APIs take the effective ID and an app author writes
// only the leaf, so "nav" under a panel with ID "detail" reaches
// nothing: FindByID answers (nil, false) and the scroll calls write an
// offset no scrollable reads. Every neighbouring API is already
// guarded from the other side — SetFocus by DebugUnknownFocus, state
// keys by DebugUnresolvedKeys, generation stamps by DebugStampDrift —
// and a lookup was the remaining hole. See issue #536.
//
// Two properties keep the finding honest:
//
// Near miss only. The report needs an identity in the frame whose last
// segment is the leaf that was asked for. A lookup for a name the
// frame stamped nowhere is a probe, not a misspelling: rtfResolveAnchor
// tries a scoped anchor and falls back to a bare slug, and a scroll
// offset set before the first frame names a widget that does not exist
// yet. Both stay silent.
//
// Package-level warn-once. Layout does not name the window that
// stamped it, and FindByID is a Layout method, so this category cannot
// use the per-window memory in debugWarn. It is keyed by the calling
// API and the id instead, and cleared when the gate's generation
// moves so re-enabling Debug after a fix reports the current state.

// debugLookupKey is the warn-once key: one report per calling API per
// id, for the life of one generation of the gate.
