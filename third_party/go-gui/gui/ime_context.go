// ime_context.go — deciding when the platform input method is live,
// and when the caret-blink animation runs.
//
// The input method must be active only while an editable text widget
// holds focus. It is not a "something is focused" signal: on macOS an
// active input context routes every keystroke through
// interpretKeyEvents:, which turns Option+I into a dead circumflex
// instead of the ModAlt shortcut the app asked for (issue #393). The
// Windows backend documents the same contract it was never given
// ("composition only becomes possible once a text widget takes
// focus", gui/backend/gl/ime_win32.go), and on X11 IMEStart is an
// ibus FocusIn that a button has no business claiming.
//
// The caret-blink animation is gated the same way (issue #403): it
// must run only while a widget that renders a framework caret holds
// focus, or the window re-renders every 600 ms for a caret nobody
// draws.
//
// It is gated on the *window* holding OS focus as well. A background
// window receives no key events, so its caret marks an insertion point
// nobody can type into — and the blink is not free: it keeps the 16 ms
// animation ticker alive and wakes the main thread out of its blocking
// event wait twice a second for the whole time the app sits idle.

// shapeIsIMEEditTarget reports whether shape is the editable text
// context an input method would write into — the shape that hosts the
// preedit in renderText.
//
// focusOwner is the discriminator: only input widgets set it
// (view_input.go), so a selection-only focusable Text is excluded. A
// read-only input is excluded too: it stays focusable for its caret
// and selection but can never commit a composition, which is the same
// rule render_text.go applies to preedit rendering.

// shapeDrawsCaret reports whether shape can render the framework's
// input caret (renderInputCursor): a text-like shape that renders
// focus state for itself or for a widget it belongs to. It is wider
// than shapeIsIMEEditTarget on purpose (issue #403):
//
//   - a read-only input stays focusable for its caret and selection,
//     so its caret blinks; only the IME gate excludes it.
//   - a selection-only focusable Text draws a caret at its cursor,
//     so it blinks like an input.

// findEditTargetsIn resolves both focus signals against an already
// loaded focus ID. The walk short-circuits as soon as both are found
// and is skipped entirely when nothing is focused, so a frame with a
// focused widget pays one shallow probe and nothing when nothing is
// focused. A focused widget can match through two shapes (Input's
// container and its inner text shape), so once one signal is found
// the walk keeps going for the other. Depth is capped like every
// other tree walk: the tree is not always the app's own, and past
// maxEventDepth the frame drops input rather than the process.
