## [v0.76.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- **`Window.SetFileAccessAppID`, `Window.RestoreFileAccess`,
  `Window.ReleaseFileAccess`, and `Window.ReleaseAllFileAccess` are public
  (#372)** — A caller that holds an `AccessiblePath` grant can now release it
  early instead of waiting for `WindowCleanup`. Set the app ID once, then call
  restore in `OnInit`; restore clears active grants first, so a second call
  cannot record the same bookmark twice. Release stops access only; the
  persisted copy stays. All four must run on the main thread — from any other
  goroutine, use `Window.QueueCommand`.
- **`Window.IsHovered` and `Window.IsPressed` read hover and press state while a
  view is built (#587)** — A view can now pick a look from whether it is hovered
  or pressed, not only recolor itself afterwards in `OnHover`. Pass the
  effective ID (`w.EffID(cfg.ID)` inside `GenerateLayout`). The answer comes
  from the last arranged frame; when it changes, the frame loop rebuilds once
  more in the same frame, so there is no visible lag. A shape drawn on top
  blocks hover, disabled shapes never hover, and a press stays recorded until
  release. Change only what is inside the widget's bounds, or the look can
  flicker. `OnHover` is unchanged. See
  `docs/specs/build-time-interaction-state.md`.
- **`examples/custom_buttons`: flat, Windows 98 and Windows XP buttons (#587)**
  — A port of go-shirei's custom-buttons demo, built on `IsHovered` and
  `IsPressed`: a 98 press moves the label 1px, an XP hover lights a gold rim.
- **`examples/family_tree`: a scrollable diagram with clickable names (#582)** —
  A family tree wider than the window, built from `gui.Canvas` with names placed
  at `X`/`Y`, a `DrawCanvas` underlay for right-angle connector lines, and a
  scrollable `Column`. The names are buttons, so click, hover, focus and
  accessibility need no hit-testing code. The canvas needs no explicit size, and
  a sideways trackpad swipe scrolls it (#584, #585).
- **The full named color palette is public** — `Magenta`, `Indigo`, `Pink`,
  `Violet`, `DarkBlue`, `DarkGreen`, `DarkRed`, `LightGray`, `LightGreen`,
  `LightRed`, and `RoyalBlue` join the exported palette alongside `Red`,
  `CornflowerBlue`, and the rest, so app code no longer re-spells them with
  `RGBA` literals. The previous lowercase spellings remain as internal aliases.
- **`ColorLookup` parses a color name or hex string with `ok=false` on miss** —
  `ColorFromString` silently returns opaque black for unknown input, which hides
  config typos. `ColorLookup` trims space, folds case (so `" Red "` matches),
  accepts `#RRGGBB[AA]`, and reports failure, including the previously missing
  `"magenta"` name. `ColorFromString` keeps its signature and fallback.
- **`AnimationCommands.AppendOnDone` and `AppendOnValue` are public** — the type
  was exported for third-party `Animation` implementations, but only the
  unexported spellings existed, so outside packages could not enqueue callbacks.
  The exported methods are nil-safe; the old spellings remain as delegates.
- **`GesturePhase` and `TouchToolType` are public** — `Event.GesturePhase` and
  `TouchPoint.ToolType` used unexported types with partly exported constants, so
  app code could read `GesturePhaseChanged` and `TouchToolFinger` but could not
  name the type or compare the other phases. All constants are now exported
  (`GesturePhaseBegan`, `GesturePhaseEnded`, `GesturePhaseCancelled`,
  `TouchToolUnknown`, `TouchToolStylus`, `TouchToolMouse`, `TouchToolEraser`,
  `TouchToolPalm`); the lowercase spellings remain as aliases.
- **`MouseLockCfg.MouseDown` is public** — the lock exposed `MouseMove` and
  `MouseUp` but kept the mouse-down intercept internal, so external drag code
  could not intercept the press that starts a drag. When both spellings are set,
  `MouseDown` runs and the internal one is ignored.
- **`SwitchCfg.TextStyleLabel` and `RadioCfg.TextStyleLabel` style the trailing
  label (#335)** — `Switch` and `Radio` used the control text style for the
  label beside the control. `Toggle` had a dedicated label style. All three now
  take `TextStyleLabel`, and zero takes the theme default. A caller that styled
  the label through `TextStyle` moves that style to `TextStyleLabel`.
- **`RegisterAppFontBytes` is public** — the docs already told app code to
  register embedded fonts through it, but only the unexported spelling existed,
  so outside packages could not populate the in-memory font list at all. The
  exported function dedupes by content and retains bytes by reference, matching
  the documented contract. `RegisterAppFont` ignores empty paths, and font
  registration is now mutex-guarded with copy-on-read at load time.
- **Correctly-spelled icon aliases are public** — `IconEllipsisH`,
  `IconEllipsisV`, `IconFrowning`, `IconOctopus`, `IconMessenger`, and `IconMap`
  alias the historically misspelled constants, and `IconLookup` answers both
  spellings. The old names and keys stay.

### Fixed

- **Web touch end and cancel carry the lifted fingers** — The browser drops
  lifted fingers from `e.touches`, so building touch-end events from it sent an
  empty event that removed nothing. The recognizer stayed wedged with the finger
  still tracked: the second tap of a double-tap arrived as a second finger of a
  phantom multi-touch, and pinch and rotate never got their Ended. End and
  cancel events now carry `e.changedTouches`, matching the iOS and Android
  backends.
- **Touch gestures end cleanly and land where the fingers lift** — A pinch that
  starts with both fingers on one point no longer reports an infinite scale. A
  fast pan that rests before the lift no longer flings a swipe. A simultaneous
  pinch and twist now ends both gestures instead of dropping the rotate. The
  mouse release that touch synthesizes now fires at the release point instead of
  the press point. A pan over a container with no scroll room now reaches the
  widgets below it instead of stopping. A finger that stays down after its
  partner lifts now starts a new press at its own position, so the tap that
  follows lands correctly and clicks. Malformed touch input no longer panics,
  and gesture dispatch now obeys the same depth cap as the mouse handlers.
- **A duplicate widget ID no longer fires keyboard handlers twice** — Two
  widgets sharing an effective ID (a bug the debug gate reports) collapsed to
  one tab stop, but both ran the focused widget's `OnKeyDown`, `OnChar` and
  `OnKeyUp`, and both activated on Space/Enter — one press could apply a
  mutation twice. The first twin in dispatch order now wins the keypress,
  matching the tab order's first-candidate rule. Scroll dispatch is unchanged:
  the focused pass still runs first and the fallback still skips it by pointer.
- **A parked focus no longer scrolls a disabled widget** — Focusing a widget
  that is disabled (a `SetFocus` the next frame's fixup has not repaired yet)
  still matched the focused scroll target, so a wheel tick reached a disabled
  widget's `OnMouseScroll`. The focused-ID walk now uses the same take-focus
  predicate dispatch uses, so the scroll falls through to the container below.
- **A rich-text style change no longer shows a stale layout** — The cross-frame
  layout cache keyed on run text and the base style only, so changing a run's
  size or family, or the hanging indent, reused the old layout. The key now
  chains run styles, the full base style, and the hanging indent, and mixes its
  inputs in sequence instead of XOR. Table column-width caching gets the same
  treatment: its key covers padding, minimum width, text styles, and
  separator-delimited cell values instead of bare concatenated text.
- **A focused scroll handler no longer runs twice per wheel tick** — When the
  focused widget sat under the cursor and declined the scroll, the focused pass
  ran its `OnMouseScroll` and the fallback ran the same callback again before
  reaching the container below. The fallback now skips the focused node it
  already ran; the cascade to the container below is unchanged.
- **A non-finite scroll delta no longer poisons the scroll offset** — A NaN
  delta passed through `f32Clamp` and stuck in the scroll map, freezing the
  container. `scrollVertical` and `scrollHorizontal` now drop a non-finite delta
  and a non-finite result, matching the smooth-scroll path.

- **A menu shortcut no longer also runs the matching command (macOS)** — When a
  native menubar item had a `Shortcut` and a command had the same chord, one key
  press ran the action twice: once from the menu and once from the command
  registry. A toggle opened and closed at once, and the menu title only
  flickered. The Metal backend saves each key-down before AppKit sees it. It now
  drops the key-down when a menu item used it as its key equivalent.
- **A container with `Gradient`, `Shader` or a blur draws its border (#589)** —
  The border is now drawn after the fill, whatever the fill is. Before, these
  containers reserved space for the border but drew no line: `ColorBorder`,
  `SizeBorder` and `BorderGradient` were ignored. A container with both `Color`
  and `BorderGradient` also lost its solid fill; it now draws both. A
  `BorderGradient` still wins over `ColorBorder`. Existing screens can change: a
  blurred dialog or a gradient button that sets `ColorBorder` now shows that
  border. The `examples/custom_buttons` XP button drops the extra container it
  used to draw its blue frame.
- **Hover no longer sticks when the pointer leaves the window or a touch lifts
  (#587)** — Metal, X11 and Win32 now report the pointer leaving the window, so
  `OnMouseLeave` fires and `OnHover` stops. Before, the last hovered widget
  stayed lit until the pointer came back. A lifted touch no longer leaves a
  widget reading as hovered.
- **A sideways trackpad swipe scrolls a container horizontally (#585)** — A
  precise scroll with no modifier used to move only the vertical axis and drop
  `ScrollX`, so a wide container ignored a sideways swipe on macOS and moved
  only with Shift or the scrollbar. Each axis the swipe names now scrolls, as
  far as the container's `ScrollMode` allows. A discrete mouse wheel keeps Shift
  for horizontal. `(*Window).TestScroll` with a non-zero `dx` now drives
  horizontal scroll through real dispatch.
- **A Canvas in a scroll container scrolls sideways with no workarounds (#584)**
  — Two layout gaps stopped it. A Fit `Canvas` resolved to 0×0 because it never
  measured its children; it now encloses them, counting each child's `X`/`Y`
  plus its size, and a Scrollable Canvas's scroll range counts the same. A Fixed
  or Fill Canvas keeps the size it was given. Separately, a Scrollable Fill
  container took its content's minimum width (and a Row its minimum height), so
  it grew as big as its content and had nothing to scroll; only a column's
  height was reset before. Every axis the container can scroll now drops that
  minimum, so `Clip: true` and a hand-sized `FixedFixed` Canvas are no longer
  needed. An axis excluded by `ScrollMode` keeps its content floor.
- **Command registry is race-safe and stops swallowing keys** — `Register`,
  `Unregister`, lookup, palette, and dispatch share a mutex and run user
  callbacks off-lock from a snapshot, so registration during dispatch cannot
  deadlock or race. A command with nil `Execute` no longer marks the event
  handled, nil events never match, `RegisterCommands` is atomic (all or none),
  empty IDs are rejected, `Unregister` clears the tail slot so closures release,
  `flushCommands` skips nil callbacks, and the native menubar honors
  `CanExecute` and nil `Execute`. `Execute` may receive a nil `*Event` and must
  nil-check it.
- **App registry is race-safe and survives a main-window close** — `OpenWindow`
  and `SetWakeMainFn` no longer race on the wake callback, and `Window.App` and
  `Window.PlatformID` are atomic, so readers on any goroutine stay consistent.
  `Unregister` hands the main ID to the oldest survivor instead of stranding
  menubar and tray calls on a dead ID, and menubar and tray actions resolve the
  live main window when they fire. Buffer-full `OpenWindow` drops log at most
  once per second with a running total, and tray creation rejects non-positive
  platform IDs.
- **Repeating keyframes resync after a stall instead of draining the backlog** —
  a minimized window or debugger break left a repeating `KeyframeAnimation` many
  durations behind, and each tick advanced only one duration, firing the final
  value once per tick until caught up. The repeat path now shares
  `resyncAfterStall` with `Animate` and the caret blink. A repeating keyframe
  with a non-positive duration also retires as a one-shot instead of returning
  true every tick forever.
- **Snapshot capture stops at the shared depth budget** — layout and hero
  snapshot capture recursed without the 256-deep guard the apply walks use, so a
  deeply nested document-built subtree could exhaust the stack. Capture now
  takes the same budget and tolerates nil shapes.
- **Tween, keyframe, spring, and transition outputs stay finite** — a custom
  easing hook returning NaN/Inf, non-finite tween endpoints or keyframe values,
  a non-finite spring target, and non-finite spring config now fall back or drop
  the frame instead of handing NaN to layout geometry. A zero-value
  `TweenAnimation` also eases with `EaseOutCubic`, matching `NewTweenAnimation`
  and the transitions.
- **View-bound heartbeats use the monotonic clock** — stamps are `time.Time`
  rather than `UnixNano`, so a wall-clock step no longer mass-cancels visible
  widgets' animations. Negative layout and hero durations take their defaults,
  the stopped scroll smoother releases its entries once the final value is
  applied, and the typewriter default duration counts runes only when
  registering its driver.
- **Modified Tab chords no longer move focus** — `Ctrl+Tab`, `Alt+Tab`,
  `Super+Tab`, and `Shift` combined with any of those fell through to focus
  traversal (`Ctrl+Tab` advanced to the next stop, `Shift+Ctrl+Tab` went forward
  instead of back), stealing chords the focused widget or the OS owns. Traversal
  now matches on the keyboard modifier bits only: plain `Tab` advances, plain
  `Shift+Tab` goes back, and any other combination is left for the focused
  widget.
- **A scoped widget can no longer inherit the dialog's focused dispatch** — the
  reserved dialog ID matched on the leaf, so any widget whose leaf spelled it
  became a keyboard-focus target. The match is now on the effective ID, which
  only the dialog itself (its own float root) satisfies.
- **Focus eligibility keys on the effective ID** — `canTakeFocus` tested the
  leaf while the focus store holds the stamped identity. The two agree for every
  generated layout; hand-built layouts no longer disagree.
- **Deep accessibility trees stop at the depth budget** — the a11y collect and
  lookup walks were the only tree walks without the shared 256-deep guard, so a
  deeply nested document-built subtree (Markdown, SVG) could exhaust the stack.
  Nodes past the budget are now dropped from the pushed snapshot instead.
- **Scoped focus is announced to assistive tech** — the a11y focused index
  compared the leaf ID against the effective focus ID, so a widget under an
  ID-bearing ancestor was never reported as focused. The match is now on the
  effective ID.
- **Assistive-tech actions queue onto the main thread** — platform action
  callbacks (VoiceOver, Android JNI, D-Bus workers) arrived on foreign threads
  and walked the live layout directly. They now run through `QueueCommand` at
  the next frame start. Disabled widgets also refuse all five actions now, not
  just Press.
- **Live regions are keyed by identity, not label** — two regions sharing a
  label (or none) collapsed onto one entry, announcing for the wrong region or
  staying silent on change. ID-bearing regions pin by effective ID across any
  tree or label movement; ID-less regions key by label and node index, going
  silent for a frame on moves rather than announcing spuriously.
- **An emptied accessibility tree is pushed, not skipped** — content that
  emptied never synced, so assistive tech kept the stale tree and the live
  baselines went stale with it. Zero-node syncs now clear the native tree on
  every backend, and returning content reads as new rather than changed.
- **Each window owns its accessibility bridge (macOS, Linux)** — the macOS
  VoiceOver tree and the Linux AT-SPI2 bridge were process-global, so a second
  window hijacked the first window's tree and actions. macOS now keeps one tree
  per window with the owning window routed back alongside each action; Linux
  gives each window its own bridge. The web backend was already per-window, and
  Android runs exactly one window by construction.
- **Combining two unset colors stays unset** — `Add`, `Sub`, and `Over` returned
  an explicitly-set color even when both inputs were the zero value, conjuring a
  color where none was specified. The result is now set if either input is set.
  `Over` also rounds to the nearest channel value instead of truncating,
  matching the HSL/HSV conversions.
- **The saturation/lightness plane renders its cache key's hue** — `planeSrc`
  keyed on the quantized hue but painted the raw one, so two sub-quantum hues
  shared a key and the second showed the first's pixels. The buffer now paints
  the quantized hue, as the wheel already did.
- **HSV construction clamps and rejects non-finite input** — out-of-range
  saturation/value and NaN/Inf hues fell through float math (including an
  implementation-defined float-to-int step) into channel bytes. Inputs now map
  to zero/clamp at the entry point, mirroring `HSLA.Normalized`.
- **The HSLA readout never prints a 360° hue** — rounding carried 359.6° to
  `hsla(360, ...)`. It now wraps to `hsla(0, ...)`.
- **Color filter singletons hand out copies** — `ColorFilterIdentity`,
  `Grayscale`, `Sepia`, and `Invert` returned the shared package singleton, and
  `colorFilterCompose` aliased its input on a nil side, so one in-package write
  would leak across users. Each call now returns a fresh copy.
- **Dock tree operations accept a nil root and `DockTreeAddTab` ignores
  repeats** — every tree walk dereferenced the root first, so a nil tree
  panicked instead of answering empty. Nil now returns nil (or false for
  lookups), and adding a panel that is already a tab returns the tree unchanged
  instead of stamping two tab buttons with one ID.
- **`DockNodeSanitize` repairs more malformed input** — beyond ratio clamping it
  now coerces unknown node kinds to panel groups, collapses over-deep branches
  to empty groups instead of leaving splits with nil children, drops duplicate
  panel IDs, points a dangling `SelectedID` at the first panel, and mints
  separator-free node IDs so a `:` in app data cannot push a group outside the
  dock scope.
- **ID lookups and the ID audit close five gaps** — `Window.ResolveID` sorts an
  exact match before trailing-segment matches, so taking the first answer gives
  the unambiguous widget instead of tree order. `Window.EffectiveIDs` (and the
  near-miss lookup built on it) stops at the shared 256-deep budget instead of
  recursing without bound. `ScopeIDN` with an empty owner no longer over-sizes
  its buffer by one byte. The `ids` audit mode flags a composition with the ID
  on the right (`"panel:" + cfg.ID`), fails closed on a file that does not parse
  instead of passing green over unscanned code, and no longer panics on a
  zero-argument `ScopeID` call.

## [v0.75.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- **`InputDateCfg.DateFormat` sets the date format per field (#578)** — the date
  input read its format from one process-global value, the active locale's short
  date, so a caller who wanted `24.12.2026` had to change the locale for every
  date widget in the app. `DateFormat` now spells it on the field, in the same
  token language the locale bundles use: `YYYY`, `MM`, `M`, `DD`, `D` and
  literal separators — `"DD.MM.YYYY"`, `"DD/MM/YYYY"`, `"YYYY-MM-DD"`. The
  format drives all four places the field uses one: the text it shows, the input
  mask, the placeholder hint, and the parse of what the user types. Unset keeps
  the locale's short date, so existing fields are unchanged. A month-name token
  (`MMM`, `MMMM`), a 2-digit year (`YY`) and time tokens (`HH`, `mm`, `ss`)
  panic at construction, because the field masks digits and the parse only reads
  `YYYY`, `MM`, `M`, `DD`, `D`: anything else could be shown but never typed
  back. To change every field at once, set the locale instead:
  `SetLocaleID("de-DE")` already carries `D.M.YYYY`.

### Fixed

- **Wrapped text now follows its container's `HAlign` (#577)** — a `Text` with
  `TextModeWrap` defaults to `FillFit`, because wrapping needs a width to wrap
  to. Filling the axis left the container's alignment nothing to move, so a
  centered column appeared to ignore its wrapped child. After the wrap pass the
  box now shrinks back to its longest line when its column aligns it, and the
  existing alignment code places it. Naming `Sizing` or `TextStyle.Align`
  yourself opts out, and a left-aligned parent is unchanged. Text long enough to
  fill every line has no slack to return: use `TextStyle.Align` to place the
  lines inside the box. See `docs/specs/wrap-text-halign.md`.

- **Native menu key equivalents for punctuation shortcuts (#576)** — the macOS
  menu encoder only passed A-Z/0-9 through to AppKit, so an item with a
  punctuation chord (e.g. Cmd+/) showed no key hint. The 12 printable
  punctuation keys now map to their key equivalents; anything else still encodes
  to nothing. Only the displayed hint changes — the chord itself always fired
  through the command registry.

- **Shader-only container with a transparent color now draws (#574)** — the
  render early-out treated gradient, border gradient and shadow as paint but not
  the custom shader, so a container whose only paint was `Shader` emitted no
  command and the shader never ran. The shader now counts as paint, and a
  `RenderCustomShader` command is emitted.

## [v0.74.0] - 2026-09-11

### Changed

- **`UpdateWindow` and `RequestRedraw` renamed to `InvalidateLayout` and
  `InvalidateRender` (#563)** — the old names promised synchronous work neither
  did. Both only set a staleness flag and wake the backend's idle loop;
  `(*Window).Update` is what rebuilds. `UpdateWindow` also read backwards
  against Win32, where `UpdateWindow()` forces an immediate paint and
  `InvalidateRect` is the flag-setter. The new pair matches
  `InvalidateListHeights`, which already meant "mark stale, rebuild later", and
  names what went stale: `InvalidateLayout` rebuilds the layout tree,
  `InvalidateRender` rebuilds only the render commands from the tree already
  arranged.

- **`UpdateView` renamed to `SetView` (#564)** — it is a setter for one field
  (`w.viewGenerator`), so Go's setter convention fits, and it pairs with
  `SetTheme`. At the dominant call site it reads correctly now: `OnInit`
  performs the first assignment, not an update (`w.SetView(mainView)`). The new
  name still reads fine on the rarer swap-the-view path.

- **BREAKING: `DatePickerRoller` requires a non-empty `Cfg.ID` (#565)** — focus
  is keyed on that ID, so an empty one produced a widget that could not take
  focus and answered no key. The factory now panics through `RequireID`, and
  `DatePickerRollerCfg.ID` carries `gui:"required"` so the `requiredid` analyzer
  reports the omission under `go vet` before the panic can happen. This matches
  `DatePicker`, `Combobox` and `ListBox`. Migration: give every
  `DatePickerRollerCfg` literal an `ID`.

- **BREAKING: `TermGrid` widget removed (#570)** — `TermGrid`, `TermGridCfg`,
  `TermGridData`, `TermCell`, `TermCursor`, `TermSelRange`, `TermAttr`,
  `TermUnderline`, and `TermReverse` are gone, deprecated since v0.73.0. The
  `RenderTermGrid` command, its per-backend draws, the print branch, and the
  `examples/termgrid` demo go with it. Migration: draw grids on a `DrawCanvas`,
  as go-term already does.

### Deprecated

- **`UpdateView` (#564)** — remains as a forwarder to `SetView`, so existing
  code (including the six siblings' `main.go` files) keeps compiling. It will be
  removed in a future minor.
- **`UpdateWindow` and `RequestRedraw` (#563)** — both remain as forwarders to
  `InvalidateLayout` and `InvalidateRender`, so existing code keeps compiling.
  They will be removed in a future minor. See
  `docs/specs/window-invalidate-naming.md`.

### Fixed

- **Date Picker Roller holds focus and answers the keyboard under a scoped
  parent (#565)** — `GenerateLayout` never resolved its effective ID, so
  click-to-focus parked focus in the void: no focus border, and the arrow-key
  and Shift/Alt year/month bindings never fired. It now resolves `cfg.ID` with
  `w.EffID`, matching `DatePicker` and `Combobox`.

- **Mouse wheel scrolls the Date Picker Roller drums (#565)** — the wheel
  handler hit-tested the drums with the shape-relative coordinates dispatch
  hands it against the drums' absolute positions, so no drum ever matched and
  the wheel silently did nothing. It now translates back before hit-testing.

## [v0.73.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- **`Stream` bridges a background producer to the window (#559)** — `gui.Stream`
  takes a channel and an apply function: each received value is applied on the
  frame thread and followed by a full layout refresh, so a window fed from
  stdin, a socket, or a ticker repaints as values arrive. Previously that shape
  stalled — nothing scheduled a frame, so the window sat stale until the next
  mouse move and then showed everything at once. Delivery is per item in channel
  order with no coalescing; the goroutine exits when the channel closes or the
  window closes. See the streaming section in `docs/dx-cheat-sheet.md`.

### Deprecated

- **TermGrid widget deprecated, removal in a future minor** — `TermGrid`,
  `TermGridCfg`, `TermGridData`, `TermCell`, `TermCursor`, `TermSelRange`,
  `TermAttr`, `TermUnderline`, and `TermReverse` are all marked deprecated. The
  only terminal in the org, go-term, renders its grid through `DrawCanvas` and
  never used this widget; the sole remaining consumer is the `examples/termgrid`
  demo. New code should draw grids on a `DrawCanvas`. Removal takes the
  `RenderTermGrid` command, its per-backend draws, and the print branch with it.

### Fixed

- **`OnMouseScroll` now receives shape-relative coordinates on both dispatch
  paths** — scroll dispatch offers the event to the focused element first and
  falls back to the shape under the cursor. The focused path handed the callback
  shape-relative coordinates and the fallback path handed it window-absolute
  ones, so which space `ctx.Event.MouseX` was in came down to whether the shape
  happened to hold focus. A `DrawCanvas` or `TermGrid` zooming at the cursor
  zoomed at the wrong point as soon as it was clicked. Both paths now go through
  the same relative-coordinate helper every other pointer callback uses.

- **Scrolling works again while a mouse button is held, on Windows and the web**
  — wheel and arrow-key scroll dispatch matched `Event.Modifiers` exactly
  against `ModNone` and `ModShift`, and the Windows and web backends OR the
  buttons currently held into that same field. A wheel turn during a drag
  therefore matched neither case and was silently dropped on those two platforms
  while working on macOS. Dispatch now masks the held-button bits off before
  matching.

- **A container wider than 10,000 children no longer loses keyboard input** —
  the 10,000-child cap is applied when the layout is generated, and event
  dispatch re-checked it and returned early. The second check could only ever
  fire on a hand-built `Layout`, and when it did it dropped that subtree's
  typing, key and focus handling while leaving its mouse handling working.
  Generation is now the only place the cap is applied.

- **Touch double-tap now registers in datagrid** — the touch-to-mouse synthesis
  path built its synthetic event without the frame stamp `EventFn` puts on every
  backend event. Consumers that time multi-click gestures by differencing
  `Event.FrameCount` — `datagrid`'s double-click-to-edit and
  double-click-to-autofit — stored frame 0 as the last click and read it back as
  "no prior click", so a second tap was never recognized as a double tap.

- **A callback can no longer have its writes to the event silently reverted** —
  pointer dispatch saved the whole `Event` before calling a callback and
  restored it afterwards, reinstating `IsHandled` by hand as the single
  exception. Any other field a callback wrote was discarded. Dispatch now saves
  only the two coordinates it actually changes, which also takes a 352-byte copy
  each way out of the per-callback path.

- **Scroll and scrollbar ID lookups tolerate a shape-less layout node** — the
  two walks that resolve a focus or scroll ID dereferenced `Layout.Shape`
  without the nil check every other tree walk in the package performs. Generated
  trees always carry a shape, so this reached only hand-built `Layout` values —
  on the path that runs for every scroll event.

- **AnimationAdd now rejects an empty animation ID** — animations are keyed by
  ID with replace semantics, so every unnamed `Animate` silently collided on
  `""` and replaced the previous one. An empty ID now panics at registration,
  matching `State[T]`'s treatment of programmer error. Correct callers are
  unaffected; a caller relying on the collision was already corrupting its own
  animation map.

- **View-bound animations no longer die when a time-travel scrub ends** (#5) —
  the liveness heartbeat was stamped and compared with the scrubbable clock, so
  scrubbing 10 minutes back stamped every visible widget at T-10min and the
  first tick after resume read 10 minutes of staleness against the 2 s
  threshold, cancelling each animation while its widget was still on screen. The
  heartbeat now uses the wall clock, which is never shown to a user and has no
  reason to be scrubbable. The `Animation.Update` doc is also corrected: `dt` is
  the nominal 16 ms step, not a measured elapsed time.

- **A diverging spring animation now snaps to its target instead of running
  forever with NaN** — `SpringAnimation` integrates with explicit Euler at a
  fixed 16 ms timestep, so a stiffness above roughly 15600 (at `Mass: 1`)
  amplified each step until velocity reached `+Inf` and position became `NaN`.
  `NaN` fails every comparison, so the at-rest check never fired: the animation
  stayed alive, called `OnValue` with `NaN` on every tick, pushed that value
  into layout geometry, and forced a full layout refresh every 16 ms for the
  life of the window. A diverged spring is now treated as arrived — it snaps to
  the target, calls `OnValue` with the target and then `OnDone`, and retires.
  Callers see a hard snap where they previously saw a frozen, CPU-burning
  window.

- **Hero transitions actually morph** — `NewHeroTransition` recorded no "before"
  geometry, so the documented sequence (`AnimationAdd`, then `UpdateView`)
  produced only a fade: every hero-marked element held its final position for
  the whole transition and no element ever travelled between the two views.
  `AnimationAdd` now captures the hero geometry of the current frame, which is
  the last moment it exists, and a hero present on both sides morphs between the
  two. A hero only on the new side still fades in; one that left the tree cannot
  fade out, because it is no longer there to draw. The redundant incoming-side
  snapshot map is gone — the apply walk runs over the incoming tree, so it never
  told the morph anything the walk did not already know.

- **A repeating animation no longer storms after a stall** — `Animate` with
  `Repeat`, and the caret blink, advanced their start time by exactly one delay
  per tick. After a stall — a minimized window, a debugger break, one very long
  frame — start sat many delays in the past, so the missed intervals drained at
  one callback per ~16 ms tick: a 5-second stall on a 16 ms repeat fired over
  300 catch-up callbacks, and the caret strobed its way back to the present.
  Once start falls more than one further delay behind, the missed intervals are
  now dropped and the animation resyncs to the present. A tick that arrives on
  time still steps by exactly one delay, so a long interval keeps its drift-free
  cadence.

- **Layout and hero transitions no longer race the animation goroutine** — the
  amend pass read a running transition's `progress` and `stopped` on the main
  thread after releasing `w.animMu`, while the animation goroutine wrote both
  under that mutex on every tick. Each frame could interpolate against a
  half-written progress, and `-race` reported it wherever a transition ran
  during a real frame. Both accessors now copy the values out inside the
  critical section, so a frame interpolates from one stable progress.

### Added

- **Easing palette exported** — `EaseInQuad`, `EaseInCubic`, `EaseInOutCubic`,
  `EaseInBack`, `EaseOutBack`, `EaseCSS`, `EaseInCSS`, `EaseOutCSS`,
  `EaseInOutCSS`, and `CubicBezier` are now public. The exported `Easing` config
  fields (`HeroTransitionCfg`, `LayoutTransitionCfg`, tween/keyframe easings)
  previously accepted functions consumers could not spell for half the palette;
  the full family is now reachable. Removed in the same pass: the unexported
  `applyHeroRecursive`, `applyTransitionRecursive`, and `propagateOpacity`
  wrappers, which production never called — tests now drive the `Depth` variants
  directly.

- **TermGrid renders on the GL and Web backends, and in print** — the terminal
  character grid previously painted only through the Metal and soft backends; on
  Linux/Windows (GL), in the browser (Web), and in PDF export the widget was
  silently blank. All three now run the same single-pass draw (background runs,
  column-pinned glyph runs, cursor, selection, underlines on screen; backgrounds
  plus text runs in print). Print additionally honors rotation brackets, which
  it previously dropped: rotated content now prints rotated instead of
  unrotated. Glow/blur filter effects, custom shaders, and live cursor/selection
  decorations remain print-skipped by design (no PDF equivalent) and are now
  grouped and documented as such in the print dispatcher rather than falling
  through silently.

### Fixed

- **Canvas draw hardening: z-order, dash loops, non-finite input** — five
  defects found reviewing `DrawContext`. A flat fill recorded after a radial
  gradient that was lowered to a shader quad merged back into the batch opened
  before it, so it painted _under_ the glow it was drawn over; a lowered fill
  now closes the batch it interrupts. `DashedLine` and `DashedPolyline` walked
  their pattern with no bound, so a non-finite endpoint hung the frame and a
  very long segment against a short pattern took the frame with it; both now
  screen their input and cap the walk. `FilledRect`, `Rect`, `Line`, `Polyline`,
  `FilledPolygon`, `PolylineJoined`, `FilledRoundedRect`, `RoundedRect`, `Arc`,
  `DashedLine`, `DashedPolyline` and `FillTrianglesColors` now reject non-finite
  coordinates and stroke widths at record time — a bad vertex reaching a batch
  cost every other primitive that had merged into it, because the whole render
  command is dropped downstream — `FillTrianglesGradient` takes the same
  non-finite screen `FillTrianglesColors` has, both take the same input bound,
  and the shape-specific gradient fills screen their geometry before recording.
  The recorder path (SVG/PDF export) baked the canvas transform into a point
  list only up to a size threshold, silently exporting a larger polyline at its
  unmapped local coordinates; every length is now mapped, and the scratch buffer
  behind it is released on reset with the rest.

- **Disabled and Opacity now reach every render path** — fading or disabling a
  widget previously dimmed only its flat fills, borders, blur, and plain text.
  Shadows, custom-shader tint, gradient fills and borders, image fills, the
  terminal grid, canvas batches/texts/gradients/image fills, text gradients, and
  untinted SVG art all painted at full strength inside a disabled or faded
  parent. Every one of those now scales alpha by the widget's opacity and halves
  it when disabled, through one shared helper, so a disabled panel dims as a
  whole. Copies are made only while dimming actually applies — the enabled path
  keeps its pointers (canvas batches reuse the frame arena, the term-grid
  zero-copy test still passes) and the render benchmark still reports 0
  allocs/op. Three factories (`TermGrid`, RTF, `DrawCanvas`) never set `Opacity`
  and ran at zero, which the old per-path code silently treated as opaque; they
  now default to 1.0, making zero mean transparent everywhere. Deliberately out
  of scope: rich-text layouts and raster image pixels carry no per-command color
  to scale, and SVG text inside a `disabledRole` theme style is already quieted
  by the theme, so those are left untouched rather than dimmed twice.

- **Filter layer counts are capped at emission and in every GPU backend** —
  `Layers` is the `feMergeNode` count of an untrusted SVG filter, and it
  previously reached the GPU composite loops unbounded (the emit path clamped
  only the soft backend). A hostile document could demand hundreds of thousands
  of fullscreen blend passes per frame. The SVG emitter now clamps to 32 and the
  GL, Metal, iOS, and Android backends clamp again at `beginFilter`, mirroring
  the soft backend's existing cap. Past a handful of layers a glow is already
  saturated, so legitimate documents are unaffected. Render-command validation
  now additionally covers the previously unvalidated kinds (`RenderLine`,
  `RenderRTF`, `RenderTextPath`, `RenderTermGrid`, `RenderFilterBegin`) and the
  command goldens record rotation, stencil depth, filter layers/matrix, image
  clip radius, term-grid geometry, and layout glyph/item counts instead of
  presence alone.
- **Scroll overflow is queryable, on both axes (#546)** — `ScrollOverflowX` and
  `ScrollOverflowY` report how much content a scrollable currently hides, as a
  positive number of pixels, and 0 when the content fits. Nothing exported
  answered this before: `ScrollVerticalPct` reads 0 both at the top of a long
  list and when there is nothing to scroll at all, so it cannot be used as the
  test. An application can now react to overflow appearing, for example to
  reserve space so an overlay scrollbar stops covering the last pixels of
  content.

  Both return `(float32, bool)`. The bool is false before the first frame is
  arranged and for an id nothing stamped, because the width alone cannot carry
  it — a miss and a scrollable with nothing to scroll both read 0, and a caller
  sizing a reservation from that would silently reserve nothing. A miss is a
  routine startup condition rather than a failure, so this is a bool and not an
  error; a misspelled id is additionally named by the `DebugUnknownLookup` gate.

  The value reports overflow, not scrollbar visibility — a scrollbar set to
  `ScrollbarVisible` paints over content that fits. It also describes the frame
  that was last arranged, so sizing a reservation from it feeds back into the
  measurement that produced it; reserve unconditionally, or hold a reservation
  once taken, rather than following the value every frame.

  Growing a scrollable by the scrollbar's thickness automatically was rejected:
  sizing resolves before overflow is known, so it is a fixed point, and Fixed
  and Fill sizing cannot grow at all. A change callback was rejected too — the
  state is recomputed every frame and would have to fire from the arrange pass
  under the frame lock, while a view function reading the getter is already the
  poll.

- **`ScrollHorizontalOffset` and `ScrollHorizontalPct` (#546)** — the horizontal
  getters were missing while their vertical twins were exported, so an
  application could set a horizontal offset but never read one back.

- **Horizontal percentage scrolling and eased scrolling are public** —
  `ScrollHorizontalToPct` joins its already-public vertical twin
  `ScrollVerticalToPct`, and `ScrollHorizontalToSmooth` /
  `ScrollVerticalToSmooth` expose the same exponential ease the mouse wheel uses
  for programmatic jumps. `ScrollHorizontalToPct` also reports an unscoped-leaf
  miss through the `DebugUnknownLookup` gate, matching the vertical form.

### Changed

- **Addressing APIs name the parameter `effectiveID` (#550)** — every API that
  takes a stamped layout identity (`SetFocus`, `IsFocus`, `FindByID`, the
  `Scroll*` family, the `Test*` helpers, `VirtualListFocusedIndex`,
  `SetVirtualListFocusedIndex`, `DatePickerReset`, `InvalidateListHeights`) now
  names its first parameter `effectiveID` instead of `id`, so autocomplete and
  the godoc signature line show the rule the doc comment already stated: a leaf
  under an ID-bearing ancestor is addressed by its full path (`"detail:nav"`),
  not by the leaf its `Cfg` was written with. Go callers pass positionally, so
  nothing recompiles differently and no migration is needed.

### Fixed

- **Showcase "Open Command Palette" button opens the palette (#554)** — the demo
  toggled the palette by its bare leaf (`"cmd-palette"`) while the palette reads
  its visibility state by effective ID (`"detail:cmd-palette"` under the detail
  panel), so the toggle wrote a key no frame ever read and the button silently
  did nothing. The demo now defers its build to generation time, resolves the ID
  with `w.EffID` in the panel's scope, and closes the button handler over that
  key — the documented pattern for a factory that addresses a widget it does not
  itself own.

- **Scroll percentage APIs no longer crash before the first frame (#546)** —
  `ScrollVerticalPct` and `ScrollVerticalToPct` walked the layout tree without
  checking that a frame had been arranged, so calling either on a window whose
  first frame has not run — during setup, or from a command that fires before
  the view does — dereferenced a nil root shape and crashed the process. Both
  now take the same guard the rest of the scroll API already used and answer 0
  (or do nothing) instead. The newly exported `ScrollHorizontalPct` carried the
  same fault and is fixed with them.

## [v0.72.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- **Shaper refusals are reported instead of degrading silently** — text the
  glyph shaper refuses, past its 10KB byte budget for example, falls back to
  approximate metrics: caret placement, selection rectangles and grapheme-aware
  delete all lose precision with nothing saying why. The new
  `DebugGlyphLayoutFallback` category (part of `DebugAll`) reports the shape
  once, with its byte length and the shaper's error.

  Profiling behind this: a keypress reshapes the whole buffer on every
  keystroke, linear in bytes (about 2.4ms and 7MB of garbage at 10KB of ASCII),
  because the layout cache keys on the full text and the caret needs character
  boundaries. Typical fields under 1KB cost about 0.25ms. An allocation gate
  (`TestInputKeypressAllocBudget`, 10KB field, real shaper) pins the
  steady-state budget so it cannot regress unnoticed; timing stays out of the
  gate as machine variance. Windowed or incremental shaping was rejected:
  shaping is not prefix-stable under wrapping and ligatures, and a wrong caret
  is worse than a slow one.

- **Canned text animations on `TextCfg.Anim` (#543)** — a `Text` can now animate
  itself. `TextAnimCfg` takes a `Kind` — fade in or out, pulse, slide from any
  of four directions, pop, shake, typewriter, shimmer — plus `Duration`,
  `Delay`, `Easing` and `Repeat`. Every field has a default chosen per kind: an
  entrance eases out over 300ms, a loop stays linear so its cycle joins up with
  no seam, and a typewriter scales its duration with the length of the text.
  `Custom func(p float32) TextAnimFrame` is the escape hatch for an effect no
  kind covers, and `TextAnimFrame` is the same value the canned kinds produce:
  opacity, reveal, offset, scale and rotation.

  An animated text needs a non-empty `ID`, because the animation and its
  progress are keyed by the effective ID — one without an ID is inert and is
  reported under `gui.Debug`'s `DebugMissingIDs`, the same way a `Focusable`
  shape with no ID already is. Nothing else changes for an existing `Text`: the
  zero `TextAnimCfg` animates nothing.

  Two behaviours worth knowing. A typewriter reserves the full string's width
  while it types, so nothing around it reflows rune by rune. And an effect with
  no motion — a fade or a pulse — deliberately installs no transform, which
  keeps it on the fast text render path; only offset, scale and rotation pay for
  the glyph-layout path.

  Per-character effects (wave, staggered fade, rainbow) are not included: they
  need per-glyph render commands in every backend. The `Kind` enum keeps that
  boundary inside `gui/`, so they can land later without an API change.

  `examples/animations/` gains a row of the looping kinds, and the showcase
  gains a **Text Animation** page under Text, which adds the entrance kinds and
  a Replay button. Replay works by giving the labels a new ID, which is how a
  one-shot animation is retriggered today: progress is keyed by identity, so a
  finished entrance stays finished until the identity changes.

  The showcase's docs sweep now covers every catalog entry rather than three
  hardcoded ones, so a demo cannot ship with an empty Docs panel again. That
  turned up the Inspector page, which had no doc either; it has one now.

### Fixed

- **Markdown copy button read the animation map without its lock (#543)** — a
  code block's copy button asked whether its check-mark animation was running
  from inside a view function, which holds the frame lock but not the animation
  lock, while the animation goroutine writes that same map. The read now goes
  through `HasAnimation`. The race was latent: it needs some other widget on the
  page to keep the animation loop running, which is what an animated text next
  to a code block now does.

- **Focus follows a widget that loses it** — disabling or removing the focused
  widget moves focus to the first tab stop (or clears it when none remains) on
  the next frame, instead of parking it on a dead ID that swallowed keys
  silently. One shared predicate — focusable, non-empty ID, not disabled — now
  decides dispatch, tab order, mouse focus, test targeting and the debug gate
  together, so the five can no longer disagree. Behavior change: `SetFocus` on a
  disabled or absent ID does not stick past the frame; the blur commit for the
  old field still fires through the usual `AmendLayout` path.

- **Untrusted text is size-bounded** — the X11 clipboard read stops at 16 MiB,
  matching the Win32 bound, so a hostile selection owner cannot grow the buffer
  without bound; `PreTextChange` and `PostCommitNormalize` returns are capped at
  the keystroke insert budget, so one runaway callback cannot pin unbounded
  per-window state.

- **Input hardening and cheaper masks** — char/key/click handlers with no
  originating event decline instead of panicking, negative cursor positions
  clamp instead of wrapping through the selection casts, event dispatch and
  focus lookups stop descending past 256 levels, and mask patterns without
  custom tokens share one compiled instance (an alloc-gate test pins the
  per-generation budget) instead of recompiling on every frame.

- **Vertical caret motion in a selectable `Text` stays on cluster boundaries** —
  with no shaped layout to consult, Up/Down fell back to line-column math and
  could park the caret between a base rune and its combining mark, so the next
  delete cut a cluster in half. The fallback now snaps to the nearest grapheme
  stop, which `Input` already did. The line-column math behind it finds line
  boundaries by scanning bytes, which needs no `[]rune` copy of the buffer, but
  counts the column in runes: a byte column carried onto a line of different
  rune widths lands mid-rune, which made Up fail to leave a line at all when the
  line above held a 4-byte rune, and made Down answer past the end of the text.
  The snap cannot repair that, because a drifted index is usually itself a valid
  cluster boundary.

- **Password fields mask with bullets everywhere** — multiline passwords
  rendered `*` while single-line fields rendered `•`, with different advances.
  The multiline mask now emits the same bullet, so measuring and painting agree
  on one glyph in both modes.

- **Programmatic input text is size-bounded like typed text** — `Input` content
  assigned by the app bypassed the keystroke/paste/callback rune budget, so an
  oversize string shaped every frame and filled the 50-deep undo history.
  Generation now truncates to the budget and reports once per identity under the
  `DebugGlyphLayoutFallback` category. Standalone `Text` stays unbounded: with
  no undo history or per-keystroke reshape, long-form display has nothing to
  bound. Clipboard pastes are pre-capped before any `[]rune` conversion, so a
  platform-sized paste no longer allocates transiently, and the shared mask
  cache stops at 256 patterns, emptying and refilling on overflow rather than
  refusing the newcomer — a pattern the cache could never admit would recompile
  on every frame, which is the cost the cache exists to remove.

## [v0.71.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- **`DialogCfg.DefaultButton` is exported again (#19)** — the field and its
  `DialogButtonNo`/`DialogButtonYes` constants were unexported by the #230 sweep
  with no caller to keep them alive. A confirm dialog reached only by a
  deliberate gesture (a quit prompt, for instance) wants Enter on "Yes"; the
  behaviour was already implemented, only unreachable from outside the package.
  Any value other than `DialogButtonYes` keeps the safe "No" default.
- **Native file dialogs take a `StartDir` again (#372)** — `StartDir` on
  `NativeOpenDialogCfg`, `NativeSaveDialogCfg` and `NativeFolderDialogCfg` was
  unexported by the #230 sweep, so every picker passed an empty directory to the
  platform no matter what the app set. The backends already honoured the value.
  An empty `StartDir` still means "platform default", and so does a value that
  cannot name a directory: the Linux backend spends the path as an argv element
  for zenity/kdialog, so a value starting with `-` or holding a NUL is screened
  back to the default rather than reaching the tool as an option.
- **`AccessiblePath` is exported (#372)** — the element type of
  `NativeDialogResult.Paths`. Callers could read `.Path` and `.Grant` inline but
  could not name the type, so a helper taking one, or a slice of their own, was
  impossible. `PathStrings()` is unchanged.

## [v0.70.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- **A debug gate for a lookup that misses on an unscoped ID** (#536) — the
  addressing APIs take the effective ID, and a leaf spelled without the scope
  its widget sits under reaches nothing: `Layout.FindByID` returns
  `(nil, false)` into the caller's usual `if !ok { return }`, and
  `Window.ScrollVerticalTo` / `Window.ScrollVerticalToPct` write an offset no
  scrollable reads. The failure is latent — a leaf is the identity at the top
  level, so the call works until the widget is dropped under a panel with an ID.
  The new `gui.DebugUnknownLookup` category, part of `gui.DebugAll`, reports the
  miss and names the identity the frame did stamp
  (`FindByID("nav") found nothing, but the frame stamped "detail:nav"`). It
  fires only on such a near miss, so probing for a widget that may be absent and
  setting a scroll offset before the first frame both stay silent. Warn-once
  memory is package-level, so findings are asserted through the debug output
  rather than through `(*Window).TestFindings`.

- **Whole-window opacity** (#516) — `Window.SetWindowOpacity` fades the entire
  window, content included, and `Window.WindowOpacity` reads the value back. A
  runtime setter rather than a `WindowCfg` field: unlike `Transparent` it fixes
  nothing about the window, so it can change after creation for a fade-in on
  show or a dim on focus loss. This is a compositor-level fade above the GL or
  Metal surface, so it composes with per-pixel `Transparent` rather than
  replacing it — macOS uses `NSWindow.alphaValue` and X11 the
  `_NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY` property. On Windows it uses `WS_EX_LAYERED` plus
  `SetLayeredWindowAttributes`, which the transparency path deliberately avoids,
  so a window created `Transparent` is refused the fade and told why through
  `gui.DebugWindowDegraded`. A call made before the backend attaches is replayed
  at window creation. Demonstrated by the Window Opacity page in
  `examples/showcase/` and by `examples/transparent/`; see
  `docs/specs/window-opacity.md`.

- **Transparent windows on macOS, Windows and X11** (#515) —
  `WindowCfg.Transparent` lets the window's alpha channel reach the compositor,
  so the desktop behind shows through wherever the content is not opaque. Plain
  transparency, no blur: `SetWindowVibrancy` remains the separate macOS-only
  blurred backdrop. macOS uses a non-opaque `NSWindow` and `CAMetalLayer`,
  Windows uses `DwmEnableBlurBehindWindow` with an empty blur region, and X11
  picks a depth-32 ARGB visual. On X11 it needs a running compositing manager;
  without one, or with a driver that offers no ARGB visual, the window degrades
  and the new `gui.DebugWindowDegraded` category says so rather than failing to
  open. An unset `BgColor` on a transparent window now clears to fully
  transparent instead of the opaque theme background. See
  `examples/transparent/` and `docs/specs/transparent-windows.md`.

- **`gui.DebugUnresolvedKeys` and `(*Window).TestFindings`** (#518) — a dev-mode
  gate for the quietest identity mistake: a widget that keys its internal state
  on the raw `cfg.ID` while `resolveShapeIDs` gives its shape a scoped effective
  ID, so state is written and read under different strings. The audit runs once
  per frame from the existing debug walk, over the identities the walk already
  collected, and does not instrument the state store. It reports only when an
  ancestor join really rewrote a shape of that leaf, so a cache keyed by a file
  name stays quiet. Like `DebugUnscopedIDs` it is **not** in `DebugAll`, because
  `gui/datagrid` is window-global by decision (#519); ask for it by name.
  _Superseded below: #519 fixed the datagrid and moved the category into
  `DebugAll`._ `(*Window).TestFindings(mask)` is the general assertable form of
  `TestDuplicateIDs`: it takes the categories to run, so an opt-in category is
  testable as data instead of stderr-only.

  ```go
  found := w.TestFindings(gui.DebugAll | gui.DebugUnscopedIDs)
  ```

- **`EffID` reports a mistimed resolve** (#520) — `w.EffID` answers with the
  bare leaf when it is called before the framework descends into the scope the
  widget belongs to, and that is also the correct answer for a widget with no
  scope above it. Failure and success were byte-identical, which is why six
  widgets carried the same bug and no test saw it. `DebugUnresolvedKeys` now
  reports the call itself: it records what each resolve answered and compares
  that with where the shape of that leaf actually landed. It fires whatever the
  widget does with the result — a state key, an inner `ScopeID`, a focus check —
  rather than only what reaches a scanned state map, and a call made entirely
  outside layout generation is reported separately with its own message.
  `(*Window).TestFindings` now installs the categories before it renders, so a
  check that records during generation is assertable.

- **`(*Window).EffectiveIDs`, `(*Window).ResolveID` and
  `gui.DebugUnknownFocus`** (#521) — the effective ID is what every addressing
  API takes, and until now an app could not learn one. It had to spell the
  string by hand from the join rule and its own View tree, and a wrong spelling
  failed in silence: `SetFocus` on an unknown ID focuses nothing,
  `ScrollVerticalTo` writes an offset no scrollable reads. `ResolveID("nav")`
  now answers with the identities the last frame stamped for that leaf —
  `["detail:nav"]` under a panel with `ID: "detail"` — and `EffectiveIDs()`
  lists the whole frame. Both read the arranged tree, so the answer is what the
  addressing APIs expect rather than a second implementation of the rule.
  `DebugUnknownFocus`, in `DebugAll`, closes the other half: a frame that ends
  with a focus ID nothing focusable claims is reported, and the message offers
  the spelling that would have worked. It runs from the frame audit rather than
  from `SetFocus`, because focusing a widget the current frame has not built yet
  is legitimate. Every public API that takes an effective ID now says so.

### Changed

- **Release archives cover both architectures, and the macOS `.dmg` is
  universal** — packaging moved into the Makefile as `package-linux`,
  `package-windows` and `package-macos`, and the release workflow calls those
  same targets, so a release can be rehearsed with `make release` before the tag
  is pushed. amd64-only archives previously left arm64 Linux and Windows on ARM
  with nothing to download, and the macOS build inherited the runner's
  architecture, so the `.dmg` would not run on an Intel Mac at all. The Windows
  binaries are linked `-H windowsgui`, so no console window opens behind the
  app.

- **CI installs 3 Ubuntu packages instead of 16** — the Linux build has been
  cgo-free since X11 moved to `jezek/xgb` and GL moved to purego, and go-glyph
  now shapes in pure Go. FreeType, HarfBuzz, Pango, fontconfig and every
  `libx*-dev` header had no caller. What remains is `pkg-config` and
  `libasound2-dev` for oto's ALSA driver, built under `-tags otoaudio`, and
  `libegl1`, which is dlopened by soname at runtime rather than linked.

- **`EventCtx.EffID` keeps its argument** (#526) — documentation only, no API
  change. #518 left open a `ctx.Key()` that would read the handler's own stamped
  identity and retire `ctx.EffID(leaf)`. An audit of every call site shows the
  seam never resolves the handler's own shape: it resolves a leaf naming a shape
  at or above the handler, and the handler's shape is often ID-less, so
  `ctx.Key()` would have replaced nothing. A rename was rejected as well — the
  seam is a kept public export, and the fallback branch joins a scope rather
  than finding an ancestor. The doc comment now states that contract, and
  `docs/specs/widget-id-per-scope-uniqueness.md` records the decision.

- **Effective IDs are stamped once, during layout generation** (#527) — identity
  used to be computed twice from the same information: `appendChildViews` knew a
  shape's exact scope while generating it and threw the answer away, then
  `resolveShapeIDs` walked the built tree at arrange time and derived the same
  string again. Two implementations of one rule drift, and #518, #519 and #520
  are what that looked like from outside. `stampEffID` is now the only writer of
  `Shape.effID`, called from `generateViewLayout` and `appendChildViews`, and
  nothing recomputes an identity afterwards. Behaviour is unchanged — the golden
  tests record no diff — and two properties that used to depend on pass ordering
  now hold by construction: a float keeps the scope of the panel it was written
  in whatever extraction later does with it, and an injected overlay (toast,
  dialog, inspector) is its own scope root. What remains of the old pass is
  `resolveFocusOwners`, which rewrites a `Shape.focusOwner` reference — the one
  identity that names an ancestor by leaf and so still needs a walk.
  `BenchmarkLayoutArrange` is 2% faster; allocations are unchanged.
- **New `gui.DebugStampDrift` category, in `DebugAll`** — reports a shape whose
  stamped identity disagrees with the scope the frame arranged it under, or an
  ID-bearing shape with no stamp at all. The second is what a hand-built
  `Layout` appended to a generated tree looks like: every store keys it on its
  bare leaf, and nothing else about the frame looks wrong. Assertable with
  `w.TestFindings(gui.DebugStampDrift)`.

### Fixed

- **Input now scrolls horizontally to follow the caret** (#534) — text wider
  than the field was clipped with no way to reach it, so the caret went
  invisible as soon as typing passed the right edge. Both modes are fixed.
  Single-line always follows the caret, the way a conventional text field does.
  Multiline wraps as before, but a run with no break opportunity is wider than
  the width it was wrapped to, and that overflow is now recorded on the shape
  (`Shape.inkOverflowW`) and counted by `computeContentWidth`, so the field can
  scroll to reach it and a `Scrollable` multiline input shows its horizontal bar
  — hidden until needed, like the vertical one. A field that is not a scroll
  container gets the offset applied to its text shape alone: making a
  single-line field `Scrollable` would trip two sizing rules that treat any
  `Scrollable` `Fill` container as elastic, resizing Inputs in a `Row` and
  collapsing data grid cells. Drag-to-select auto-scrolls on both axes now, and
  a password field's caret geometry and measured width are read against the
  bullets it renders rather than the raw text, which had put the caret at the
  wrong offset.

- **WithTooltip and Menubar now resolve their IDs at generation time** (#528) —
  the last two widgets of the class #518, #519 and #520 fixed. Both took a
  `*Window` and built eagerly in the factory body, which runs while the parent's
  `Content` slice is assembled — before the framework descends into the
  container the widget will sit in. `WithTooltip` therefore called `w.EffID`
  against the enclosing scope, so the same tooltip text in two ID-bearing panels
  shared one hover entry, and `Menubar` never resolved at all, keying selection,
  focus and its AmendLayout closure on the bare leaf while its own shape
  resolved under the panel. Each now defers the build behind the documented
  pattern, so the resolve happens with the scope live.

  **Behavior change.** A tooltip or menubar inside an ID-bearing ancestor now
  carries the effective ID it always should have, so a hand-spelled
  `SetFocus("bar")` on a scoped menubar must become `SetFocus("panel:bar")`.
  Both are window-global in the common case, where nothing changes.

- **Sidebar, InputDate and Table now resolve their IDs at generation time**
  (#518) — all three built eagerly in the `(*Window)` factory, which runs
  _before_ `generateViewLayout` descends the View tree. The ID scope stack is
  empty there, so `w.EffID` returned the leaf unchanged and the widget keyed
  scroll offset, focus, open state and row heights on a name that is
  window-global. One instance worked; a second instance of the same `cfg.ID`
  under another panel shared its state. Each now defers the build, so the
  resolve happens with the scope live.

  **Behavior change.** A Sidebar, InputDate or Table inside an ID-bearing
  ancestor now carries the effective ID it always should have. Public APIs take
  the effective ID, so a hand-spelled call must follow: a table with
  `ID: "catalog"` inside a panel with `ID: "detail"` moves from
  `w.SetFocus("catalog")` to `w.SetFocus("detail:catalog")`. Compose it with
  `gui.ScopeID`, never by hand. Unscoped widgets are unaffected. Turn on
  `DebugUnresolvedKeys` to find the rest.

- **`datagrid` resolves the grid's own ID** (#519) — `datagrid.New` built
  eagerly and never resolved `cfg.ID`, so every state slot the grid owns (column
  widths, presentation cache, CRUD working copy, data-source state) was keyed on
  the raw leaf while the grid's root shape resolved to its effective ID. Two
  grids sharing a `cfg.ID` under different panels were distinct shapes with one
  state slot, and their children collided outright. `New` now returns a deferred
  view; the build resolves once, at the top, and every state key, child ID and
  header reverse-parse prefix derives from that one string.
  `DebugUnresolvedKeys` moves into `DebugAll` as a result, so `gui.Debug(true)`
  reports an unresolved state key without being asked.

  **Behavior change.** Every ID a scoped grid publishes moves: `catalog:row:3`
  becomes `detail:catalog:row:3`. An app that spells a grid or one of its parts
  by hand for `gg.FindByID`, `gg.SetFocus`, `gg.ScrollVerticalTo` or
  `datagrid.GetSourceStats` must pass the effective form. Compose it with
  `gg.ScopeID`, never by hand. An unscoped grid is unaffected.

- **`ContextMenu` resolves its ID at generation time** (#520) — the resolve was
  present but ran in the factory body, before the descent into the panel the
  menu sits in, so a context menu inside an ID-bearing ancestor keyed its open
  state, its saved focus and its popup ID on the bare leaf. The build is now
  deferred. Same behavior change as the widgets above: a scoped context menu
  carries the effective ID, so a hand-spelled `SetFocus` must follow.

## [v0.69.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- **`NumericInput` steps with the arrow keys** (#503) — Up and Down step by
  `StepCfg.Step`, with the existing Shift (10x) and Alt (0.1x) multipliers.
  Stepping is on by default because arrow keys are the spinbox convention; turn
  it off with `StepCfg.KeyboardDisabled`. The handler consumes the event only
  when it actually steps, so an arrow that does not step still reaches an
  enclosing list, and a read-only field declines the key rather than swallowing
  it. Wheel stepping stays opt-in behind `StepCfg.MouseWheel`, because a field
  that eats the wheel stops the form under the pointer from scrolling; it is now
  wired up rather than merely accepted.

- **`ergonomics-audit -mode deadcfg`** (#505) — a gate for exported `*Cfg`
  fields nothing consumes. It classifies every read rather than counting
  references, so it catches a field that is only ever copied into a field of the
  same name and never acted on: the shape that let `NumericStepCfg.Keyboard` and
  `.MouseWheel` ship inert (#503). Wired into `make ergonomics-audit`, advisory
  until its findings clear. The first run also turned up `ThemeCfg.RadiusLarge`
  and `ThemeCfg.FillBorder`, which no code reads; both are kept on purpose and
  now carry a marker. Mark a deliberate keep with
  `ergonomics-audit:deadcfg-keep <reason>`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `Scrollable` is removed from `ListBoxCfg`, `TreeCfg`, `TableCfg`
  and `CommandPaletteCfg`; these widgets always scroll** (#504) — following
  `ComboboxCfg` in v0.68.0. A list that does not scroll is not a choice anyone
  makes, and the flag also gated virtualization, so a 10k-row `ListBox` without
  it built every row: a performance cliff hidden behind an ergonomics flag. On
  `CommandPalette` the flag was worse than useless — the results column was
  hardcoded scrollable while the flag only gated reading the offset, so a
  scrolled palette rendered blank rows (see Fixed, below). Delete the line;
  scroll state is still keyed by `Cfg.ID`. Content that fits gains an inert
  scroll region: `scrollVertical` clamps and returns false when the offset does
  not move, so the wheel event still bubbles to the page.
- **`TableCfg.FreezeHeader` now works on its own** (#504) — it used to require
  `Scrollable` as well (`freeze := cfg.FreezeHeader && cfg.Scrollable && ...`),
  so a caller who set only `FreezeHeader` got nothing, with no report. Removing
  `Scrollable` dissolves the dependency. **This is a visible layout change in
  code you did not touch:** a table that set `FreezeHeader` without `Scrollable`
  renders as a header zone plus a body zone instead of one flat column, and its
  scroll key becomes `ScopeID(Cfg.ID, "scroll")`.
- **A `Table` with no `ID` no longer joins the scroll system** (#504) — scroll
  state is keyed by ID, so there is nothing to key. `TableCfg.ID` is
  `gui:"required"`, so `go vet` already rejects this; `gui.Debug` reports it at
  runtime. The alternative was `requireScrollID` panicking on a decision the
  caller never made.
- **BREAKING: `NumericStepCfg.Keyboard` is now `KeyboardDisabled`** (#503) — the
  field never did anything: nothing read it, so a `NumericInput` could not step
  by keyboard whatever the caller set. Now that stepping works it defaults on,
  and the field spells the opt-out to match the `FocusDisabled` house style.
  Delete `Keyboard: true`; replace `Keyboard: false` with
  `KeyboardDisabled: true`.

### Fixed

- **A scrolled command palette showed blank rows** (#504) — the results viewport
  is always `Scrollable`, but the virtualized window read the scroll offset only
  when the caller had set `CommandPaletteCfg.Scrollable`. With the flag unset
  the window stayed pinned at index 0 while the viewport scrolled, so scrolling
  past the first screen revealed the trailing transparent spacer instead of
  items. The offset is now always read.

## [v0.68.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- **Themable scrollbar insets** — `ThemeCfg` gains `SizeScrollbarGap` and
  `SizeScrollbarGapEnd`, which seed `ScrollbarStyle.GapEdge` (the inset from the
  edge the bar tracks) and `ScrollbarStyle.GapEnd` (the inset at the two ends of
  the track). Both were hardcoded to 3 and 2 in `ThemeMaker`. They are
  `Opt[float32]`, so a theme can ask for a zero gap — a scrollbar flush against
  the edge — without that reading as "unset". Unset keeps the previous values,
  so no built-in theme changes.
- **Showcase theme maker: pad, scrollbar and offset knobs** — the Theme page
  gains three numeric fields beside Radius and Border. Pad drives the whole
  padding ladder from one value (`PaddingField` stays alone, since it sets
  form-control height). Scrollbar sets `SizeScrollbar`; Offset sets
  `SizeScrollbarGap`. All three round-trip through Save Theme / Load Theme. The
  showcase's own detail panel and sidebar dropped their hardcoded `GapEdge`
  overrides, which had been masking the theme value.

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `ScrollbarCfg.GapEdge` and `GapEnd` are now `Opt[float32]`**
  (#498) — zero used to read as "unset" and silently take the theme's inset, so
  a widget could not ask for a scrollbar flush against its edge. Wrap the value,
  `GapEdge: gui.SomeF(4)`; unset still takes the theme.

### Fixed

- **Combobox and select label clipping** (#496) — a value wider than the field
  pushed the disclosure arrow out past the border instead of being cut off at
  it. Both widgets now put the label in a clipping fill row that drops its
  `MinWidth` floor so the arrow stays inside the field.
- **Horizontal scrollbar track inset** (#497) (#499) — the horizontal branch of
  `scrollbarAmendLayout` subtracted `GapEnd` from `X` instead of adding it, so
  the track began 2px outside its container and was 4px short on the other side.
  The thumb inherited the shift. Now both axes inset symmetrically.

## [v0.67.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- **Minimum and maximum window size** (#494) — `WindowCfg` gains `MinWidth`,
  `MinHeight`, `MaxWidth` and `MaxHeight`, in the same logical pixels as
  `Width`/`Height`. The limits are handed to the OS at window creation, so the
  resize drag itself stops at the bound instead of the app trying to correct an
  already-applied size. Zero on a field leaves that bound unset; a ceiling below
  its floor is raised to the floor; `FixedSize` still wins over all four. On
  macOS and Windows the ceiling also caps the maximize button. Honored by the
  macOS, Windows and X11 backends; the web backend fills its viewport as before
  and ignores them. Details: `docs/specs/window-size-limits.md`.

- **`buildapp` packages Windows and Linux, not only macOS** — `-platform`
  selects the packager, defaulting to the host `GOOS` so every existing
  invocation keeps working. `-platform windows` embeds an icon into the PE image
  (a `.rsrc` section carrying `RT_ICON` and `RT_GROUP_ICON`, from a `.png` or a
  `.ico`) and writes a `.zip`; `-platform linux` writes a `.tar.gz` holding the
  binary, a freedesktop `.desktop` entry with `Terminal=false`, a hicolor icon
  and an `install.sh` that installs into `~/.local`. `make release` and the
  release workflow now package all three targets through it, so the Linux
  tarball is menu-installable and the Windows `.exe` carries its icon. Details:
  `cmd/buildapp/README.md`.

- **Markdown render callback** (#484) — `MarkdownCfg.RenderBlock` is consulted
  for every parsed block during layout, so an app can add a block type markdown
  does not have (callouts, numbered headings) or drop one, without rewriting the
  source string. It receives a styled `MarkdownElement` — the block's kind, its
  runs, its plain text, its index, and the document's resolved effective ID —
  and returns a replacement view, `nil` to drop the block, or `ok=false` to take
  the default renderer. The showcase dog-foods it with `> [!NOTE]` /
  `> [!WARNING]` / `> [!TIP]` callouts. Spec:
  `docs/specs/markdown-render-callback.md`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `ComboboxCfg.Scrollable` is removed; the dropdown always scrolls**
  (#492) — the field was opt-in, so a caller who set `MaxDropdownHeight` or took
  the theme default got a cap that did not cap. Scrolling is now the behaviour,
  not a choice, which is what `Select`'s dropdown already did
  (`gui/view_select.go`). Callers that set `Scrollable: true` delete the line;
  callers that never set it gain a reachable list. A dropdown short enough to
  fit is unchanged, because the scroll system adds no scrollbar when the content
  fits.

### Fixed

- **`WindowCfg.FixedSize` was a silent no-op on X11** (#494) — only the macOS
  and Windows backends honored it; an X11 window stayed freely resizable. X11
  has no resizable style bit, so the fix rides on the `WM_NORMAL_HINTS` property
  added for the window size limits: a fixed window is expressed as minimum ==
  maximum. Linux apps that set `FixedSize` will see their windows stop resizing,
  which is the documented behavior they already asked for.

- **A combobox dropdown painted its rows outside itself** (#492) —
  `MaxDropdownHeight` capped the dropdown container but nothing held the rows
  in, so a list longer than the cap drew over whatever was behind the dropdown.
  The dropdown now scrolls, so its viewport clips the overflow and the rows
  below the cap stay reachable with the wheel and the arrow keys. Found in
  go-speedtest, where a 40-entry server list drew about 12 rows past the bottom
  border, over the chart behind it.

- **Text stayed pinned to the old monitor's DPI after a window moved between
  displays** (#490) — a `TextSystem` reads its scale from the backend once, at
  construction, so glyph shaping and rasterization kept the density of the
  display the window was created on while shapes and canvases followed the new
  one, and text spilled out of the boxes laid out for it. Every backend now
  pushes a changed scale into both halves of the text stack (quad placement and
  `(*glyph.TextSystem).SetDPIScale`). Windows additionally handles
  `WM_DPICHANGED`, which was unhandled: the process is per-monitor-v2 aware, so
  the system does not resize the window itself and no `WM_SIZE` followed a
  monitor move — nothing resynced at all. macOS gains
  `windowDidChangeBackingProperties`, which is the only notification a
  Retina-to-non-Retina move sends when the window's content size does not
  change. Requires go-glyph v1.25.0.

- **RTF link activation dropped anchors and relative links** (#488) — the
  context menu's "Open Link" had no anchor branch, so `#some-heading` went to
  the platform opener, which rejects every scheme outside http/https/mailto, and
  the error was discarded: left-click scrolled to the heading, the menu did
  nothing. Relative links (`/docs/x`, `./y`, `?q=1`) failed the same way on both
  paths. Both call sites now share one `rtfOpenLink` path: an anchor scrolls, an
  http/https/mailto link opens, and anything else — a relative link with no
  document base URI, an unresolved anchor, a failed opener — is reported through
  the `gui.Debug` gate (`DebugCallbacks`) instead of failing in silence.

- **A link click in selectable text started a drag-select** (#488) — both
  selectable paths (`rtfSelectOnClick` and `markdownBlockOnClick`) ran link
  activation and then armed drag-select on the same click, locking the mouse.
  The release never came back to the widget — the link had opened a browser,
  scrolled the view away, or raised the context menu over the pointer — so the
  lock stayed up and the pointer kept extending the selection with no button
  held. A click that activated a link now still collapses the selection under
  the pointer, the way a browser drops the old highlight, but no longer arms the
  drag. A click on a non-link run is unchanged.

- **Drag-selecting past the top or bottom of a paragraph stopped mid-line** —
  `glyph.GetClosestOffset` snaps an out-of-band y to the nearest line and then
  still reads the column from x, so a drag carried above a paragraph selected
  its first line only as far as the pointer's column, and one carried below
  selected the last line only that far. All four drag paths (Text, Input, RTF
  and markdown) now widen the hit test once the pointer leaves the text band:
  upward takes the line through its beginning, downward through its end, which
  is what every platform's text view does. Inside the text nothing changes. The
  markdown path gets the same rule in the gap between two blocks, where the hit
  test picks the block above.

- **Windows builds opened a console window** — neither `make build-windows` nor
  the release workflow passed `-H windowsgui`, so the loader gave the process a
  console and every launch showed an empty terminal window behind the app
  window. Both now set it.

- **Markdown list at the end of a document** (#484) — the pending-list flush
  lived inside the list branch of `markdownBuildContent` and fired only on the
  last block, so a document ending in a list depended on that branch being
  reached. It now runs after the loop, where every exit path reaches it. Output
  for existing documents is unchanged, pinned by the new `markdown_blocks`
  golden.

### Changed

- **Default bundle identifier is now slugged** — `buildapp` derived it by
  lower-casing the display name, so `-name "Go-Gui Showcase"` produced
  `local.gogui.go-gui showcase`: invalid as a `CFBundleIdentifier` and unusable
  as a freedesktop icon key. It is now `local.gogui.go-gui-showcase`. A name
  with no spaces or punctuation is unaffected. Pass `-id` to pin the old value.

## [v0.66.1] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- **iOS simulator link** (#482) — `ff3287d8` raised the gradient shader to
  twelve stops and added `metalSetGradientTM2` to the macOS Metal backend and to
  the iOS header/Go call, but never added the body to
  `gui/backend/ios/metal_darwin.m`. The static archive built, but `xcodebuild`
  linking `IOSDemo.app` failed with
  `Undefined symbols: _metalSetGradientTM2 for arm64`. The missing symbol is now
  implemented (`setFragmentBytes` at index 0, matching macOS), and CI now builds
  the simulator `.app` so a future mismatch fails the PR instead of the release.

## [v0.66.0] - 2026-09-01

Widget audio feedback covers every mechanical widget and every remaining
interaction — keyboard activation, drag-drop and input rejection — with a native
system-sound player that needs no assets; the canvas gains a transform stack,
windows gain frameless mode, the solar-system example gains a calendar ring,
asteroid belt and rotation axes, and audio resampling and music playback are
fixed alongside an allocation-free DrawCanvas redraw.

### Added

- **Widget audio feedback phase 4** (#469) — the interactions with no click site
  now sound, and a second built-in player renders every cue with the platform's
  own event sounds.

  Three cues joined the vocabulary: `SoundNotify` (a toast appeared),
  `SoundOpen` (a dialog opened) and `SoundSuccess` (a submit was accepted), with
  matching `Theme.Sounds` fields. Every refusal reuses `SoundError` — an
  error-severity toast, a submit blocked by validation or a pending validator,
  and a `datagrid` CRUD save failure. Toast severity is the one place a severity
  picks a cue; `ToastCfg.Sound` still names the toast's buttons, and
  `SoundDisabled` silences both. `FormCfg` gained the usual `Sound` /
  `SoundDisabled` pair, where `Sound` names the accepted submit and a refusal
  always takes the theme's error role. Closing stays silent: `DialogDismiss` and
  `ToastDismiss` make no sound, because the button that closed the surface
  already did.

  `gui.NewSystemSoundPlayer(w)` is the new player: `NSSound` on macOS,
  `PlaySound` with a registry alias on Windows, freedesktop sound-naming ids
  through `canberra-gtk-play` on Linux. Unlike `NewBeepSoundPlayer`, which plays
  the system alert and so only suits `SoundError`, it has a sound for every cue,
  and it needs no assets and no audio library. It ignores gain — system event
  sounds carry no app-level volume on any of the three platforms — while
  `SetSoundVolume(0)` still mutes, because the gate sits ahead of the player.
  The capability reaches the platform through an optional interface rather than
  a new `NativePlatform` method, so no out-of-repo backend breaks, and a
  platform without it is silent rather than broken.

  `(*Window).PlaySoundCue` is exported for widget packages outside `gui/`:
  `gui/datagrid` has no button to hang a CRUD failure's cue off. The enum stays
  open and append-only — a player must keep ignoring cues it does not recognise.

  See `docs/widget-sound.md` and `docs/specs/widget-audio-feedback.md`.

- **Canvas transform stack** (#474) — `DrawContext` gained `Translate`,
  `ScaleBy`, `Save` and `Restore`, so drawing code written once in its own
  coordinate space can be placed and resized without transforming a single
  coordinate by hand. Both are relative and compose: `Translate(dx, dy)` shifts
  the origin in current local units, `ScaleBy` multiplies the scale on each
  axis, and `Save`/`Restore` bracket a change so it cannot leak into what
  follows. `Restore` on an empty stack does nothing — `OnDraw` runs inside the
  frame, so a panic there would take the window down.

  The method is `ScaleBy`, not `Scale`, because `DrawContext.Scale` is the
  device pixel ratio field. It is unrelated and unchanged.

  The transform applies to everything: positions, stroke widths, font sizes,
  image rects and gradients. Geometry is not rewritten on the CPU — the matrix
  rides on the render command, where every backend already applies it — so a
  transformed canvas costs no more per vertex than an untransformed one. Four
  limits follow from that: curves are flattened in local space, so scaling a
  circle up leaves it as faceted as the unscaled one; a non-uniform scale
  positions and sizes a text run but does not shear its glyphs; a negative scale
  moves an image's rect but never mirrors its content; and a concentric radial
  gradient under a non-uniform scale gives up the single-quad shader path for
  the ring mesh, which is more triangles for the same picture.

  `TextWidth` and `FontHeight` answer in local units — the space `Text` takes
  its arguments in — so their results must not be scaled again. A transform
  derived from application state is an `OnDraw` input like any other: bump
  `DrawCanvasCfg.Version` when it changes, or the cached tessellation is reused.

  A `DrawRecorder` (SVG/PDF export) receives transformed coordinates, so
  existing implementations need no change. PDF export now honors a command's
  affine, which also fixes animated SVG printing at the wrong position. New:
  `DrawCanvasTriBatch.Transform`. See `examples/draw_canvas` and
  `docs/specs/draw-canvas-transform.md`.

- **Frameless windows** (#473) — `WindowCfg.Decorations` selects the native
  window frame. `gui.DecorationNone` removes it entirely;
  `DecorationHiddenTitlebar` hides the macOS title bar while leaving the window
  controls floating over the content. The zero value, `DecorationDefault`, is
  the standard frame every existing caller already gets. Honored by the macOS,
  Windows and X11 backends; a documented no-op on web, iOS and Android.

  A window with no frame has nothing the user can grab, so two gestures ship
  with it: `Window.StartWindowDrag` and `Window.StartWindowResize(edge)`, both
  called from an `OnMouseDown` handler. Each hands the gesture to the OS, so
  window snapping and edge tiling keep working. macOS needs no resize grip — a
  borderless window still resizes from its edges — so `StartWindowResize` is a
  no-op there. New: `gui.WindowDecoration`, `gui.WindowEdge`. See
  `examples/frameless` and `docs/specs/frameless-windows.md`.

- **Widget audio feedback reaches the keyboard and drag paths** (#468) — phases
  1 and 2 hooked every interaction event dispatch can see. The interactions that
  call a callback directly, usually with a nil `Layout`, now raise their own
  cue: `Table`, `ListBox` and `Tree` keyboard activation sound `Selection`,
  `Menu` keyboard activation sounds `Click`, a drag-reorder drop and a dock
  panel drop sound `Selection`, and the splitter's collapse toggle sounds
  `ToggleOn` / `ToggleOff`.

  `SoundError` gets its first real consumer, which is what `NewBeepSoundPlayer`
  was built for: an `Input` sounds it whenever a keystroke is refused — a
  character a mask has no slot for, a paste that does not fit, a backspace over
  a mask literal, or a `PreTextChange` veto — and an arrow key or a step that
  cannot move sounds it too. A successful Enter commit sounds `Click`.

  Movement is silent, refusal is not: an arrow key that moves a selection makes
  no sound, because a held key would machine-gun the cue. Continuous drag stays
  silent throughout — slider thumb, splitter handle, colour plane and wheel — as
  do a drag cancelled with Escape, a drop that lands where the item already was,
  and an `Input` commit caused by blur. Each of those is a recorded decision in
  `docs/specs/widget-audio-feedback.md`, not an omission.

  New: `TableCfg`, `InputCfg` and `SplitterCfg` gained the `Sound` /
  `SoundDisabled` pair. `SliderCfg` and `NumericInputCfg` gained `SoundDisabled`
  alone — neither has an activation moment to sound at, so a `Sound` field would
  name a cue that never plays. On an `Input`, `Sound` names the Enter-commit cue
  only; rejection always takes the theme's `Error` role.

- **Widget audio feedback reaches the whole widget set** (#467) — the sound seam
  from #446 proved itself on `Button` and `Toggle`; every other mechanical
  widget now emits a cue, plus `gui/datagrid`. `Switch`, `Radio`,
  `RadioButtonGroup`, `ExpandPanel`, `ColorSwatch`, `Breadcrumb`, `ThemePicker`,
  `Select`, `Combobox`, `ListBox`, `Tree`, `TabControl`, `MenuItem`, `Dialog`,
  `Toast`, `DatePicker`, `CommandPalette`, `DockLayout`, `Image` and `Svg` each
  gained the same `Sound` / `SoundDisabled` pair, and `DataGridCfg` gained one
  for the whole grid. Still silent by default: an app opts in exactly as before.

  New: `gui.SoundSelection` and `SoundSet.Selection`, the role for picking one
  option out of several — a radio, a list row, a tab, a calendar day — which
  `SoundsDefault()` now fills. `gui.ResolveSoundCue` is exported so a widget
  package outside `gui/` spells the precedence the same way instead of
  re-deriving it.

  Widgets that only absorb clicks stay silent by design: the toast scrim, the
  context-menu dismiss layer, scrollbar tracks, the command-palette card, the
  `DatePicker` field, and the caret-placement click inside an `Input`.
  `gui.Text` is out of scope — its handler record is shared package-wide.

- **Opt-in widget audio feedback** (#446) — widgets can now play a sound when
  the user activates them. Silent by default, and silent unless the app opts in
  twice: a theme naming a cue per role (`theme.Sounds = gui.SoundsDefault()`)
  and a player installed on the window (`w.SetSoundPlayer(...)`).

  New in `gui`: `SoundCue` (`SoundNone`, `SoundClick`, `SoundToggleOn`,
  `SoundToggleOff`, `SoundError`), the injected `SoundPlayer` interface,
  `SoundSet` with `SoundsDefault()`, `Theme.Sounds` / `ThemeCfg.Sounds`,
  `NewBeepSoundPlayer` (system alert on `SoundError`, no assets, no audio
  library), and `(*Window).SetSoundPlayer` / `SoundPlayer` / `SetSoundVolume` /
  `SoundVolume`. Volume is window state clamped to `0..1` where `0` is mute —
  there is no separate mute flag.

  A cue is semantic, not a sample path, which is why `gui` still does not import
  `gui/audio`. The player is injected like `TextMeasurer` and `SvgParser` and is
  nil in tests. `Button` and `Toggle` carry `Sound` and `SoundDisabled`;
  precedence is `SoundDisabled > Cfg.Sound > Theme.Sounds.<role>`, resolved at
  generation time, so a `Toggle` picks on-vs-off from its own state with no
  extra field pair. The cue rides the shape's event record rather than a
  closure, and fires before `OnClick` independently of `ctx.Consume()` on all
  four activation paths: mouse, Space, Enter, and the accessibility press
  action.

  Guides at `docs/widget-sound.md` and `examples/showcase/docs/widget_sound.md`,
  design record in `docs/specs/widget-audio-feedback.md`, and a "Sound Feedback"
  page plus a working synthesized player in the showcase. Remaining widgets are
  phased in as follow-ups to #446: #467, #468 and #469.

- **`examples/solar_system`: calendar ring, asteroid belt and rotation axes**
  (#437) — three antique-orrery elements, all in the example, no engine change.

  The calendar ring lies in the orbital plane just outside Neptune (`dialInner`
  780, `dialOuter` 830 world units) with month names, day ticks and a marker
  that tracks Earth's orbital angle — the way a real orrery reads the date.
  Three concentric rails are `Arc` ellipses squashed by `diskTilt`; ticks and
  the twelve labels share one `FillTrianglesColors` mesh. Month text cannot be
  `dc.Text`: `TextStyle.RotationRadians` does not skew or squash, so a glyph
  could not lie in the plane. A stroke font built in the example is placed by
  arc length (`dθ = x/R`) so names curve along the ring, projected with
  `worldToScreen`, then thickened perpendicular in screen space for uniform
  weight; every segment becomes a quad in the same batch. The plane's
  foreshortening (`diskTilt = 0.48`) is compensated per label — tangential world
  extents are inflated by `1/ft` and radial by `1/fr` where
  `ft = √(sin²θ + cos²θ·diskTilt²)` — so December/June at east/west (tangent
  vertical, `ft ≈ 0.48`) keep the same screen width as March/September, with an
  inter-glyph gap of `0.14` em to avoid touching at `≈6.3` px per glyph
  (`dialEmWorld = 15`) in the full-system view. `dialAngle` maps a full Earth
  year to one turn; labels gate on a legibility threshold and the whole dial
  culls when its projected radius exceeds a few canvas widths (a selected planet
  at 30×).

  The asteroid belt is 600 rocks between Mars and Jupiter (`[250,340]` world
  units) built once with a fixed PCG seed. Each carries
  `orbitA/ecc/phase/periodS` with `periodS = orbitPeriod(orbitA)` from the
  table's own compression (`realAU=(a/195)^(1/0.38)`, then `realDays^0.45×0.8` —
  Mercury 6.0, Earth 11.4, Jupiter 34.6), a density hump and thin Kirkwood gaps,
  and an out-of-plane `zOff` that reaches the screen as `-zOff·cosElev·zoom`.
  One vertex-colored square per rock, culled off-canvas, into a single
  `FillTrianglesColors` batch; inner rocks lap outer ones because the period law
  is the same for belt and planets. Paint order after `drawOrbits` before
  `drawSun`; depth sorting is unnecessary at 1–2 px.

  Rotation axes are a line through each planet's pole. `axisDir` lifts the
  `initSurface` derivation to a standalone helper
  `(sinθ, −cosθ·cosElev, cosθ·diskTilt)` as a unit vector in camera coordinates.
  Length `1.35×` screen radius; drawn as two 1 px `dc.Line` halves so the sphere
  occludes the far one (far dimmer, near brighter; Saturn interleaves back
  rings/body/front rings between them). Gated on `r ≥ 5 px` so the full-system
  view is not a hedgehog. Costs in geometry are about one extra planet body in
  three or four batches; scratch meshes keep the frame allocation-free.

  Shared helpers extracted from the existing code: `ellipsePos` generalises
  `orbitPos` and `orbitPeriod` encodes the table's period compression.
  `tickSecs` is `0.00304` so Earth's 11.4 s simulation period maps to 60 s wall
  clock — one Earth year per minute (≈32 s Mercury, ≈10 min Neptune). Framing
  sizes to `dialOuter` (margin 1.04) rather than Neptune.

### Changed

- **`examples/solar_system`'s granulation is a mesh, and now actually has the
  falloff it always claimed.** Each convection cell was a stack of three nested
  translucent circles, meant to give the blob a soft edge. Every circle in the
  stack carried the same color, so `getBatch` merged the whole polarity into one
  batch — and a backend takes one coverage mask per batch, which flattened the
  stack back into a single hard-edged disc. The falloff was paid for and thrown
  away.

  A cell is now one triangle fan carrying its falloff as vertex alpha, opaque at
  the center and transparent at the rim, with lit and dark cells in separate
  meshes so a bright cell over a dark one still composites. The fans read their
  offsets from a unit circle built once at startup, so placing 70 cells costs no
  trigonometry at all — the old path went through `arcPoints`, whose per-segment
  `math.Cos`/`math.Sin` was 8.7% of the frame on its own.

  Measured at 1100x760, Apple M5, whole frame through the real pipeline:

  | view        | frame time    | triangles      | FilledCircle calls |
  | ----------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
  | full-system | 597 -> 532 us | 22.0k -> 15.6k | 126 -> 24          |
  | jupiter     | 948 -> 798 us | 36.0k -> 21.4k | 219 -> 9           |

- **An animated `DrawCanvas` now redraws without allocating.** Steady-state
  redraw goes from 51 allocations and 341 KB per frame to zero and zero, and
  ~40% less time with it (`BenchmarkDrawCanvasRedraw`, 300x300 canvas, Apple
  M5). This is an engine change; every `DrawCanvas` consumer gets it.

  `renderDrawCanvas` built a zero-valued `DrawContext` for every redraw and
  dropped the cache entry it was replacing, so each frame re-allocated the same
  triangle batches at the same sizes — starting each at cap 128 and growing by
  doubling to tens of thousands of floats — and every tessellation scratch
  buffer (arc points, bezier flattening, gradient subdivision) restarted from
  nil. For a canvas animating at 60 fps that is hundreds of MB/s of garbage, and
  a CPU profile of one showed ~85% of the frame in GC and page-return rather
  than in drawing.

  The context is now parked in the window's scratch pools and rebound per
  canvas, and the outgoing cache entry's buffers are recycled into the redraw
  that replaces it. Nothing about the emitted geometry changes: the golden suite
  is byte-identical.

  Buffer lifetime does change, so a `RenderCmd` is now only valid for the frame
  that emitted it. Print export, the one in-tree consumer that outlives its
  frame, copies the geometry out; third-party code that stashes `Renderers()`
  across frames must do the same. A canvas drawn twice in one render pass —
  which takes duplicate effective IDs — falls back to allocating rather than
  overwriting geometry already queued.

- **`examples/solar_system` draws a frame in 161 calls instead of 1093** (#429),
  with 40-60% fewer allocations behind it. No engine change; every fix is in the
  example. The example drew each effect as a stack of primitives, one draw call
  apiece, and each call opens or extends a batch.

  Four of them collapse to one call each. The sun's disc was 14-96 opaque
  circles faking a gradient — but opaque shells composite to nothing, and the
  ramp they sampled is piecewise linear, so five stops and one
  `FilledCircleGradient` reproduce it exactly and drop the banding it showed at
  small sizes. The corona was 576 polygons and the starfield 220 rectangles;
  both are now a single `FillTrianglesColors` mesh, which is safe because
  neither field overlaps itself. The starfield's eight-level alpha quantization,
  which existed only to keep the batch count down, goes with it, so the twinkle
  is continuous. The granulation keeps its separate circles — the cells overlap
  on purpose and merging them would change how they blend — but its count now
  scales with the sun's pixel radius instead of drawing a canvas-filling texture
  onto a 70px disc.

  The draw path also stops recomputing orbit positions that `recompute` cached a
  moment earlier.

  Measured at 1100x760, 500 iterations x 5 runs, Apple M5:

  | view        | draw calls  | batches  | allocs/frame | bytes/frame     |
  | ----------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------ | --------------- |
  | full-system | 1093 -> 161 | 79 -> 42 | 341 -> 208   | 3.15 -> 2.19 MB |
  | jupiter     | 1128 -> 239 | 97 -> 22 | 488 -> 184   | 4.40 -> 3.75 MB |

  Frame time moves less than the draw-call count does, because the benchmark
  measures tessellation rather than submission: full-system 778 -> 725 us and
  jupiter 1168 -> 1096 us, both about 6-7%. The counts above are now enforced as
  regression budgets rather than logged and forgotten.

- **`audio.LoadMusicBytes`** — loads a music track from in-memory bytes, so a
  track embedded in the binary can stream as music instead of being buffered
  whole as a `Sound`. Mirrors `LoadSoundBytes`; format is detected from the
  leading magic bytes. `examples/solar_system` now loads its ambience this way,
  which drops about 22 MB of resident decoded audio.

### Fixed

- **Audio played at the wrong pitch and speed unless the asset happened to match
  the output rate** — `gui/audio` decoded WAV/OGG/FLAC/MP3 and fed the result
  straight into a mixer running at the rate `audio.Init` opened (44100 Hz by
  default), with no rate conversion anywhere in the package. A 16 kHz file
  therefore played 2.76x too fast, about 1.5 octaves sharp, which is what the
  solar_system ambience track was doing. Decoded audio now converts to the
  output rate: a `Sound` converts once in `LoadSoundBytes`, so playback stays a
  plain buffer read with no per-play cost, and music converts as it streams
  because its decoder must stay seekable for looping and rewind. Assets already
  authored at the output rate take an identity path and are untouched.

- **`audio.RewindMusic` never rewound anything** — it type-asserted the playing
  streamer to a `beep.StreamSeeker`, but the chain's outermost wrapper is a
  volume control, so the assert always failed and the call was a silent no-op.
  The decoder is now reached through a handle held for that purpose, and the
  seek runs on the audio thread at the top of the next fill rather than from the
  caller's goroutine, where it would tear the decoder mid-read.

- **`examples/showcase/docs/widget_audio.md` documented functions that are not
  exported** — `audio.Quit`, `audio.LoadSound`, `Sound.SetVolume`,
  `SetMusicVolume`, `PauseMusic`, `ResumeMusic`, `RewindMusic`,
  `FadeOutChannel`, `PauseChannel`, `ResumeChannel`, `IsMusicPlaying` and
  `IsMusicPaused` are all unexported in `gui/audio`. Corrected to the surface
  the package actually has.

## [v0.65.0] - 2026-08-25

Gradients and per-vertex color reach `DrawContext`, and the SVG gradient
tessellator gets the same fixes: correct spread, no winding seams, and radial
subdivision that stops splitting geometry already aligned to the ramp. Idle
windows now block instead of polling, and a background window no longer wakes
the main thread to blink a caret nobody can see.

### Added

- **Procedural planet surfaces and axial spin in `examples/solar_system`** —
  each planet now carries a generated surface texture and turns on a tilted
  axis: Jupiter's belts drift past, Earth shows continents and ice caps, Venus
  turns retrograde, and Uranus rolls rather than spins. Rotation periods are
  compressed like the orbital ones (`|realHours|^0.45`); axial tilts are real.

  No engine change was involved, and that is the interesting part. There is no
  textured-triangle path in go-gui — `FillTrianglesColors` carries per-vertex
  colors and no UVs anywhere — so the surface is sampled on the CPU once per
  mesh vertex and folded into the color that vertex already had. Sampling costs
  no new transcendental per vertex: the body axes are pre-transformed into
  camera space once, the sampling direction linearizes over each ring in the
  `cos`/`sin` the mesh had already computed, and the shading ramp folds to an
  affine `channel*k + w`. Textures are generated at init from 3D noise on the
  sphere direction, which is seamless in longitude by construction, and each
  one's mean is normalized back onto its `Planet.Color` so nav dots, labels and
  small-body tone are unchanged. Still zero allocations per frame.

  Mesh ceilings rise from 36x64 to 72x128 to carry the extra detail, which is
  invisible at ordinary zoom (a full-system frame is 79 batches and 31.6k
  triangles either way) and costs 99.6k triangles against 85.9k at maximum zoom,
  where both ceilings actually bind.

- **Per-vertex color fills on `DrawContext`** (#400) —
  `FillTrianglesColors(tris, colors)` takes caller-supplied geometry and one
  color per vertex. Nothing is evaluated on the way through: no projection, no
  stop isolines, no subdivision. It is the primitive the gradient fills are
  built on, exposed for shading a gradient cannot express.

  A gradient's level sets are conic curves, nested and stepped linearly, so a
  shading whose isolines are not nested, or which varies around a center rather
  than away from it, or which stops at a silhouette, is out of reach however the
  stops are arranged. A Lambert-shaded sphere is all three at once: the isophote
  at `N·L = k` is an ellipse of semi-axis `√(1−k²)`, a point at `k = −1`, the
  full limb at the terminator, a point again at `k = 1`.

  `examples/solar_system` is ported to it. A planet body was 20–48 flat bands,
  one batch each, with visible quantization at large radii; it is now a single
  watertight mesh in one batch with a continuous ramp, and the ring count that
  used to hide the quantization came down by more than half. A full-system frame
  went from 232 triangle batches and 40.6k triangles to 79 and 30.2k.
  `examples/draw_canvas` gains a per-vertex panel: a bilinear corner blend and a
  hue sweep, neither of which any gradient emits.

  No backend change — the batch rides the same `RenderCmd.VertexColors` channel
  a gradient fill does. A `DrawRecorder` that does not implement the new
  optional `DrawVertexColorRecorder` receives one flat polygon per triangle at
  that triangle's mean color, so an export path never drops a shaded mesh.

  Callers own one invariant the gradient path handled for them: every triangle
  in a mesh must wind the same way. `gui/backend/soft` rasterizes the batch as
  one path with signed coverage accumulation, so a reversed triangle cancels
  against its neighbours and cuts a hairline seam.

- **Gradient fills on `DrawContext`** (#398) — a canvas fill can take a
  `gui.CanvasGradient` in place of a flat `Color`: `FilledRectGradient`,
  `FilledCircleGradient`, `FilledArcGradient`, `FilledPolygonGradient`,
  `FilledRoundedRectGradient`, and `FillTrianglesGradient` for caller-supplied
  geometry. Linear and radial, with pad/reflect/repeat spread and no stop-count
  limit. Geometry left at zero is derived from the shape being filled, so a
  centered glow needs only its stops.

  This replaces the stacked-geometry workaround a non-flat canvas fill used to
  require. `examples/solar_system` drew its sun halo as up to 140 concentric
  discs, where ring count was the smoothness knob and seams showed when it was
  turned down; it is now one fill.

  There is no new shader and no backend change. A gradient batch carries one
  color per vertex on the existing `RenderSvg` command, a channel Metal, GL,
  web, software, iOS and Android already consume — and so does PDF export. A
  `DrawRecorder` that does not implement the new optional `DrawGradientRecorder`
  receives the equivalent flat primitive shaded with the ramp's midpoint, so an
  export path never drops a gradient fill.

- **`InputCommitEnter` and `InputCommitBlur`** are exported. `OnTextCommit`'s
  second parameter is an `InputCommitReason`, but its values were unexported, so
  an app could receive the reason and not branch on it — the whole point of
  distinguishing "the user pressed Enter" from "focus moved on".

- **`DebugCallbacks`** joins `DebugAll`. It reports app callbacks the frame pass
  dropped because they kept re-queueing themselves round after round.

### Fixed

- **Caret blink no longer wakes an unfocused window** — the blink animation was
  gated only on which widget held focus _inside_ the window, not on whether the
  window held OS focus. A backgrounded app with a focused text field therefore
  kept the 16 ms animation ticker alive and woke the main thread out of its
  blocking event wait twice a second, forever, to blink a caret nobody could
  type into.

  `syncBlinkCursor` now folds `Window.focused` into the gate. Losing focus
  retires the animation, which empties the animation map and parks the ticker
  outright; regaining it re-registers the animation with the caret solid and a
  fresh 600 ms phase. The caret is not drawn while the window is unfocused,
  matching native macOS and Windows text fields — the rect is still emitted,
  transparent, so the render list keeps one shape across focus states and the
  in-place blink patch (#404) stays valid. Only the caret blink is gated: other
  animations keep running so a background window's in-flight motion does not
  stall and jump.

- **SVG gradients: seams, spread and a 32x tessellation cost** (#399) — the SVG
  gradient tessellator now carries the fixes that landed on the canvas one in
  #398, and one bug found in the porting.

  A multi-stop linear gradient came out with mixed triangle winding: the isoline
  splitter sorts a triangle's three vertices by gradient parameter, and an odd
  number of swaps reverses the triangle. `gui/backend/soft` rasterizes a mesh as
  one path with **signed** coverage accumulation, so two neighbours wound
  against each other cancel along their shared edge and the background shows
  through. On a six-stop diagonal fill that was three visible cracks across the
  square.

  `spreadMethod` was dropped entirely for `objectBoundingBox` gradients — the
  default units, so most of them. Every `reflect` and `repeat` gradient that did
  not spell out `gradientUnits` padded instead. Subdivision also ran on the
  clamped projection while the coloring ran on the spread one, so even where the
  spread survived, the cuts landed nowhere near the ramp's folds and the bands
  smeared into a wash. Both are fixed; the folds are now breakpoints the
  splitter cuts at.

  Radial subdivision split on edge length (`R/24`), which cannot tell geometry
  already aligned to the gradient's isolines from geometry that bulges across
  them. A triangle fan struck from the gradient's own center has zero
  interpolation error at any edge length and paid the full split anyway: 74
  wedges became 75,776 triangles. The criterion is now curvature deviation — how
  far an edge's midpoint parameter departs from the average of its endpoints —
  and the same fan stays at 74, with the rendering unchanged to within a delta
  of 4 out of 255. A rectangle filled radially, which does bulge, still refines
  until it is flat.

  Radial gradients now reach the stop-isoline pass as well, so a hard color
  break inside a radial ramp has somewhere to land; cuts on a radial isoline
  solve the quadratic rather than interpolating, which is what keeps the split
  watertight.

  `gui/canvas_gradient.go` and `gui/svg/tessellate_gradient.go` stay separate
  implementations — `gui/svg` imports `gui`, so the dependency cannot reverse —
  and each now names the other.

- **A fade to transparent no longer fades to black** — `SampleGradientStopColor`
  interpolates in premultiplied space, where zero alpha carries no hue, and
  returned transparent black. Any consumer that interpolates in straight-alpha
  space — a vertex-colored triangle mesh, on every backend — read that as a real
  color, so a white glow darkened as it faded. The nearer stop's hue is now
  kept.
- **Software backend: a vertex-colored mesh no longer shades from a neighbour's
  extrapolation** — `shadeTriangle` writes a half-pixel skirt past each
  triangle's edge so the mesh's outer edge does not thin, but the write was
  unconditional, so the last triangle painted won even where another one
  actually contained the pixel. A fan of narrow wedges — a glow struck from its
  own center — had its whole inner region shaded from extrapolated weights. A
  triangle may now only overwrite a pixel it fits better than the one already
  there.

- **Tab out of a text input no longer freezes the app** (#394) — the Input's
  blur commit fired from its `AmendLayout` hook, which `layoutArrange` runs
  while `Update` holds the window mutex. An `OnTextCommit`/`OnBlur` handler that
  called back into `SetFocus` — the natural thing to do from a commit handler,
  and what `examples/todo` did — deadlocked the main thread against itself: a
  frozen window, no panic, no CPU burn. App callbacks reached from the frame
  pass are now raised and run after the lock is released
  (`gui/window_deferred.go`).
- **macOS Option+printable shortcuts reach the app** (#393) — `keyDown:` routed
  every key through `interpretKeyEvents:` and treated any resulting preedit as
  an input-method claim, so on the US layout Option+I (the circumflex dead key)
  never arrived as `ModAlt|KeyI`, and the pending accent then composed itself
  into the next keystroke. A preedit started with no editable text widget
  focused is now discarded and the key-down delivered. CJK composition and
  Option+e → é inside a focused input are unchanged.
- **A key the input method declines mid-composition reaches the widget** (#393)
  — `keyDown:` claimed every key while a composition was live, so Tab could not
  leave a field with a dead key pending: the accent committed, `insertTab:` came
  straight back through `doCommandBySelector:`, and the key was dropped anyway.
  A declined key is now delivered, held back just long enough for the
  composition it committed to arrive first, so the text lands in the field being
  left rather than the one taking focus.

### Changed

- **A window API called while the frame lock is held now panics instead of
  hanging** (#394). `SetFocus`, `ClearFocus`, `UpdateView`,
  `ClearDrawCanvasCache` and `Window.Lock` probe with `TryLock` and, when a
  frame pass owns the mutex, panic naming the API and the remedy
  (`QueueCommand`). This is the case an app's own `ContainerCfg.AmendLayout` /
  `ButtonCfg.AmendLayout` hook can still reach — the hook exists to mutate the
  tree in place, so it cannot be deferred. A crash that says what to fix beats a
  freeze that says nothing.
- **`ctx.Layout` is nil in a blur-triggered `OnTextCommit`, `OnBlur` and
  `OnTextChanged`.** These now run after the arrange pass, and the tree they
  were raised from is rebuilt from pooled arenas before then, so the pointer
  would dangle. `ctx.Window` and the text argument are unchanged. The Enter
  commit path is untouched and still carries a live `ctx.Layout`.
- **`examples/todo` adds a task on Enter only**, not on blur. Tabbing out of a
  half-typed task left the draft as a silently created todo.
- **The platform input method is activated only for editable text widgets**
  (#393). `IMEStart`/`IMEStop` used to fire on any focus change to any focusable
  widget; they now follow the focused widget's edit context, decided each frame
  from the arranged tree (`gui/ime_context.go`,
  `docs/specs/ime-text-context.md`). This is the contract the backends already
  documented: Windows keeps the IMM context detached, X11 no longer sends ibus a
  `FocusIn` for a button, and the web backend no longer moves DOM focus into its
  hidden `<input>`. A consumer text widget not built on `Input` — one that
  handles `EventChar` itself and sets no `focusOwner` — no longer composes dead
  keys; plain characters still arrive.

## [v0.64.0] - 2026-08-21

Visual refresh (`docs/specs/visual-refresh.md`, phases 1–8): type ladder and
density, accent ramp, radius ladder and elevation, focus rings in every preset,
button variants, retuned progress/boolean sizing, registry down to dark, light
and the platform pairs.

### Added

- **`ExpandPanelCfg.FocusDisabled`** — opts the header row out of the tab order
  and its focus ring, matching the `FocusDisabled` opt-out the sixteen
  focus-by-default input Cfgs already carry. For decorative or demo panels where
  keyboard toggling is not wanted.

- **`ThemeCfg.SizeFieldMinWidth` / `Theme.SizeFieldMinWidth`** — the MinWidth
  floor a text-bearing form control takes when its Cfg states none, seeded to
  160 in `baseCfg()` so every preset carries it. Zero means no floor, not
  "derive the default": a hand-built `ThemeCfg` that leaves it unset asks for
  Fit-to-content. `Input`, `NumericInput`, `InputDate`, `Select` and `Combobox`
  consume it; a Cfg stating its own `MinWidth` or `Width` opts out. This retires
  four literals in `ThemeMaker` (`MinWidth: 75` / `MaxWidth: 200`, spelled once
  on `selectStyle` and again on `comboboxStyle`), which is why a `Select` and an
  `Input` in one row disagreed on width for a reason neither the theme nor the
  caller stated.

### Changed

- **`Form` and `Table` default their `Sizing` to `FillFit`,** for the same
  reason as `ExpandPanel` below. `Table`'s header and body zones were already
  `FillFit`/`FillFill` inside a Fit outer, so a table hugged its columns and its
  focus ring stopped short of the row it sat in; a form shrink-wrapped to its
  widest label row. No example set `TableCfg.Sizing` at all, and the two that
  set `FormCfg.Sizing` were spelling the new default by hand.

- **`ExpandPanel`'s header puts the disclosure arrow at the trailing edge.** A
  flexible spacer between the head view and the arrow absorbs the surplus width.
  Previously the arrow hugged the head view, which only looked right while the
  panel shrink-wrapped.

- **`ExpandPanel` defaults its `Sizing` to `FillFit`.** Left at the zero
  `Sizing` (FitFit) the panel widened to its longest unwrapped line, and since a
  container does not clip, it painted through its own border and off the window;
  a `TextModeWrap` body inside it never wrapped, because a Fill child in a Fit
  parent has no width to wrap against. A disclosure panel is a full-width block
  whose height follows its body, so it now picks that default the way
  `Breadcrumb`, `MenuBar`, `Sidebar`, `Splitter`, `TabControl` and `DockLayout`
  already do. Callers wanting the old shrink-to-fit set `Sizing: gui.FitFit`
  explicitly.

- **`selectStyle` and `comboboxStyle` are no longer width-capped.** The old
  `MaxWidth: 200` stopped a `Select` given `FillFit` in a 900px row at 200px
  with no way for the caller to see why, and it would have silently defeated the
  labelled-field fix below. A caller wanting a ceiling sets `MaxWidth` on the
  Cfg. `maxDropdownHeight` is unrelated and unchanged.
- **An unsized labelled field is now 160px wide, not the width of its content.**
  Behaviour change for any app relying on a labelled `Input`, `Select`,
  `Combobox`, `NumericInput` or `InputDate` shrink-wrapping its text.
- **A `Row`'s stated `MinWidth` is now border-box** (issue #385). `layoutWidths`
  added the row's padding and inter-child gap sum on top of the caller's
  `MinWidth` on a row but not on a column, so `Select` and `Combobox` (rows of
  three children) arranged at 193px under the 160 field floor while an `Input`
  beside them arranged at exactly 160. A row now takes a stated `MinWidth` as
  the whole width budget — matching the column branch and `MaxWidth` — and
  arranges narrower by its padding and spacing than before. Behaviour change for
  any app calling `Row(ContainerCfg{MinWidth: X})`.

### Removed

- **Six theme presets** (`docs/specs/visual-refresh.md` §7, phase 8):
  `dark-no-padding`, `dark-bordered`, `light-no-padding`, `light-bordered`,
  `blue-dark` and `blue-dark-bordered` are gone from the registry. The registry
  now holds eight: `dark` (the default), `light`, and the platform pairs
  `macos`/`macos-dark`, `gnome`/`gnome-dark`, `windows`/`windows-dark`.
  Migration: `dark-bordered` was identical to `ThemeDark` (bordered is the
  default), `light-bordered` is `ThemeLight.WithBorders(true)`, the no-padding
  pair is `Theme.WithBorders(false)` plus a `ThemeMaker` padding override, and a
  blue variant is a `ThemeMaker(ThemeCfg{...})` call. Name-based `ThemeGet` for
  any removed name now misses; `ThemePicker` lists eight.

### Fixed

- **A `ListBox` painted its keyboard-focus row and its mouse-hover row the same
  grey, and the focus row did not follow a click.** Two separate defects with
  one symptom: a list could show a focus highlight on the first row, a hover
  highlight on a third, and the selection wash on a second, with nothing to say
  which was which. Clicking a row called `OnSelect` but never touched
  `nsListBoxFocus`, so the focus index stayed at its default 0 and the next
  arrow key resumed from the stale row; `Tree` already did this correctly in
  `treeRowClick`. A click now moves the focus index onto the clicked row and
  gives the list window focus (unless `FocusDisabled`). The focus row takes an
  accent ring instead of `ColorHover` (visual-refresh section 4.3), so it can no
  longer be confused with hover. Reorderable rows get the ring too — they
  carried no focus indication at all. The ring is stroked from `AmendLayout`
  rather than set as a Cfg border: a border there insets content, which would
  have added its width to every row in the list. Its width is named once
  (`listBoxRingWidth`) rather than taken from the list's own `SizeBorder`, which
  is 0 in a borderless theme and would have left `ThemeLight` with no visible
  keyboard cursor.

- **A labelled field could not fill its row** (`docs/specs/visual-refresh.md`
  section 1). `labelledField` hardcoded `Sizing: FitFit` on the wrapper
  `Column`, so the caller's sizing was unreachable: an
  `InputCfg{Sizing: FillFit}` inside a `FillFit` `Row` still arranged at the
  width of its text. Nine widgets route through that function, so no labelled
  field in any app built on this toolkit could fill its row. The wrapper now
  takes the field's width mode and pins its own height to `Fit`, so the
  label/field stack still hugs its content. A Cfg that never set `Sizing` gets
  the wrapper it got before. `ColorFields` and `DatePicker` pass `FitFit`
  explicitly — neither Cfg has a `Sizing` field, and both are fixed-shape by
  design.

- **Dock panel state was orphaned by any rearrangement of the dock tree** (issue
  #389). A dock group's container carried its bare `DockNode` ID, so its
  effective ID was the splitter path that happened to lead to it — and the group
  scopes its panel content, so a drop anywhere in the dock re-keyed every widget
  inside every panel: scroll offset, focus, input state. The group container now
  takes `ScopeID(dockID, node.ID)` and the splitter
  `ScopeID(dockID, "split", node.ID)`, both absolute and independent of tree
  position; tab and close buttons scope under the dock ID rather than
  window-global `dock_tab:` / `dock_close:` prefixes. Node IDs minted on a drop
  join with `-` instead of `:`, so they stay parts rather than reading as
  absolute IDs. A panel group with an empty ID is no longer a drop target: it
  used to resolve to the dock container itself and offer the whole dock as its
  zone. `DockLayout` gets its first golden recording.

## [v0.63.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **`gnome`/`gnome-dark` and `windows`/`windows-dark` theme presets** (issue
  #374 pattern). Adwaita-derived and WinUI-derived platform themes, registered
  like the `macos` presets and reached by name through `ThemeGet`: hairline
  borders, platform corner rounding (GNOME rounder, Windows squarer), platform
  accent colors, and subtle popover/dialog elevation. Both keep the platform's
  hard accent outline for focus (`ColorBorderFocus`) instead of the macOS glow —
  `FocusRing` stays nil. Fonts stay unpinned so each resolves to the machine's
  system face (Cantarell on GNOME, Segoe UI on Windows).

### Fixed

- **`Wrap` + `Overflow` on one container hid children that fit** (issue #380).
  The two flags express contradictory strategies for the same condition — `Wrap`
  breaks content onto a new row, `Overflow` hides the tail behind a trigger —
  and nothing arbitrated between them. When a wrap container's content fit a
  single row, `layoutWrapContainers` kept its left-to-right axis and
  `layoutOverflow` then hid a child anyway, because it reserves room for a
  trigger button that a wrap never has. `Wrap` now wins: `layoutOverflow` skips
  any container with `Wrap` set, and the new `DebugWrapOverflow` category (part
  of `DebugAll`) reports the combination once per window. Scrollable containers
  were already unaffected.

- **`Wrap` stopped wrapping once the child count grew past the window width**
  (issue #378). `layoutWidths` seeded a container's min-width floor with the
  full single-row inter-child gap sum, which is right for a plain `Row` but
  wrong for `Wrap` and `Overflow` — both exist so the container can be narrower
  than one row of content. The floor therefore grew linearly with the child
  count (`(n-1) * Spacing`), and once it exceeded the available width the fill
  pass clamped the container back up to it, so wrapping measured against a width
  wider than the window and rows spilled past the right edge. Only visible in a
  non-maximized window, and only past the item count where the floor overtook
  the real width — hence "wraps at 40 items, overflows at 50". A wrapping or
  overflowing container now floors at its widest single child plus padding. Not
  verified against the reporter's repo, which pins released v0.51; the fix lands
  on the unreleased line.

- **Restored caller-facing `*Cfg` fields unexported by the #230 surface sweep**
  (issue #372). The sweep unexported every symbol with no in-repo external
  reference, including configuration fields users set directly in struct
  literals. Restored: `SvgCfg.FileName`/`NoAnimate`,
  `SelectCfg.SubheadingStyle`/`NoWrap`, `ListBoxCfg.SubheadingStyle`,
  `InputCfg.PreTextChange`/`PostCommitNormalize`,
  `NumericStepCfg.ShiftMultiplier`/`AltMultiplier`/`MouseWheel`/`Keyboard`,
  `ContainerCfg.OnScroll`, `OnIMECommit`, `ClickOnSpace`, `ClickOnEnter`,
  `ClipContents` and `FloatAutoFlip`, the
  TabControl/Breadcrumb/Menubar/ContextMenu/Splitter/Slider/Scrollbar/DockLayout
  style ladders, `ThemeCfg` size/font/elevation knobs, `WindowCfg`
  `AllowedSvgRoots`/`MaxImageDownloads`/`HistoryBytes`, datagrid's `DataGridCfg`
  and `GridColumnCfg` surface, and ~80 more fields across every widget Cfg, plus
  their enum types (`FormValidateOn`, `SpringCfg`, `ToastSeverity`,
  `DatePickerRollerDisplayMode`, `GridColumnPin`, `GridCellEditorKind`,
  `GridPaginationKind`, `GridAggregateCfg`, `GridCellFormat`, `MathFetcher`,
  `MermaidFetcher`, `PrintHeaderFooterCfg`).

## [v0.62.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- **Headless frame rendering: a software rasterizer and `RenderToPNG`** (issue
  #333). go-gui could not produce a pixel image of a frame without a GPU and a
  window, which ruled out CI screenshots and pixel-level regression tests.
  - New package `gui/backend/soft`: `RenderToImage(w, scale)`,
    `RenderToPNG(w, scale, path)` and `Release(w)`. It replays the same flat
    `[]RenderCmd` stream the GPU backends and the PDF printer consume, so no
    existing backend changes and none consults it. `scale` is the device pixel
    ratio; a window that has not rendered yet has its `OnInit` run first, so the
    same window value passed to `backend.Run` can be passed here instead.
  - Text is real, not approximated. The package implements `glyph.DrawBackend`
    over a CPU framebuffer and installs the resulting `glyph.TextSystem` as the
    window's `gui.TextMeasurer`, so shaping, metrics and glyph rasterization are
    the code the GPU backends already run — go-glyph is pure Go.
  - `(*Window).SetHeadlessRender` / `HeadlessRender` mark a window as rendering
    headlessly, suppressing wall-clock-driven visuals (today the blinking caret)
    so repeated captures of one window state produce the same pixels.
  - Phase 1 covers clip, rect, stroke rect, circle, line, gradient, gradient
    border, image and every text kind. See
    `docs/specs/headless-software-rendering.md` and `examples/headless_png/`.

- **Software rasterizer phase 2: SVG, shadow and blur, filters, stencil,
  rotation, terminal grid** (issue #360). `gui/backend/soft` now draws every
  render kind the pipeline emits, so a headless capture is the frame rather than
  the subset of it phase 1 could rasterize.
  - `RenderSvg` rasterizes the tessellated triangle list, honouring `HasXform`,
    `RotAngle` and `VertexAlphaScale` in the same order the GL backend applies
    them. Triangles are filled in runs of one colour so a shape's interior edges
    cancel instead of showing as antialiasing seams; a triangle with per-vertex
    colours is interpolated barycentrically.
  - `RenderShadow` and `RenderBlur` rasterize their rounded rect into a coverage
    mask and blur it with three box passes, the shadow additionally erasing the
    part that would sit under its caster.
  - Filter, stencil and rotation brackets share one mechanism: the bracketed
    commands draw into a pooled offscreen layer, and the matching end composites
    it back with the effect applied — a coverage mask, an inverse-mapped
    resample, or blur plus colour matrix plus repeated composite. Because the
    layer is composited rather than the geometry transformed, the effects hold
    for text and images, not only for shapes.
  - `RenderTermGrid` renders the terminal character grid — background runs,
    selection, cursor styles, column-pinned glyph runs and underlines — so
    go-term can capture a terminal headlessly.
  - Hostile input is bounded rather than trusted: blur radii and filter layer
    counts are clamped, NaN extents and corner radii are rejected before they
    reach the rasterizer, and compositing saturates instead of wrapping a
    colour-matrixed pixel to near-black.
  - `RenderCustomShader` remains unsupported by design: it is GLSL, and there is
    no CPU equivalent to compile.

- **`VirtualList` — virtualized lists whose rows may differ in height, and
  index-addressed scrolling** (issue #332). Virtualization was arithmetic over
  one scalar row height, which is exact for a widget that owns its row shape and
  useless for rows the caller builds; and a row virtualization had not built
  could not be scrolled to at all, because `scrollToView` resolves through
  `FindByID`.
  - `VirtualList`/`VirtualListCfg` build only the rows near the viewport and
    hold the rest of the space in two spacers, sized from a per-list prefix-sum
    (Fenwick) height model that seeds from an estimate and converges on measured
    heights. `ItemHeight` is the cheap path — exact from frame 1, no
    measurement. `ItemKey` stores measured heights under a stable identity, so
    an insert, delete or reorder keeps each height on its own item. `OverscanPx`
    tunes how far past the viewport rows are built, in pixels rather than rows.
  - `Window.ScrollToIndex`, `ScrollToIndexAt(frac)`, `ScrollIndexIntoView` and
    `ScrollToEnd` address rows by index through the height model, so they reach
    rows that do not exist this frame. `ScrollToEnd` is the correct
    pin-to-bottom: `ScrollVerticalToPct(id, 1)` takes a percentage of a content
    height that virtualized rows only estimate, so it drifts.
    `Window.InvalidateListHeights` re-measures a list whose content changed
    under a stable key.
  - `ListBox`, `Table`, `Tree`, `Combobox` and the command palette register the
    uniform (O(1), no per-item storage) form of the same model, so the index API
    works on them too. Index spaces differ per widget — a frozen table header is
    data index 0 but sits outside the scrollable, and the combobox indexes its
    _filtered_ items.
  - `Window.VirtualListFocusedIndex` / `SetVirtualListFocusedIndex`: an unbuilt
    row has no shape to hold focus, so a virtual list's keyboard focus is an
    index on the list.
  - A row must not turn the width `ItemView` hands it into a width it demands:
    `MinWidth` taken from that argument ratchets the list wider every frame, and
    each width change re-wraps every row, so the list never settles. `Debug`
    reports it (the `DebugListBoxNoHeight` category) after four consecutive
    frames of widening with the window unchanged.
  - See `docs/specs/virtualized-variable-height-lists.md` and
    `examples/virtual_list`.

- **Keyboard navigation for `Table`, `ColorSwatch` and the `ExpandPanel`
  header** — the three widgets the #335 audit recorded as "not focusable" (issue
  #345).
  - `TableCfg.Focusable` opts a table into the tab order. Focus lands on the
    table; Up/Down/Home/End move an active row — tinted with the hover color,
    scrolled into view under virtualization, and synced to mouse clicks — and
    Enter/Space activate the active row the way a click would. Selection follows
    movement when `OnSelect` is set; Shift extends a range under `MultiSelect`.
    `TableCfg.ColorBorderFocus` (theme-backed) paints the focus ring.
  - The `ExpandPanel` header now joins the tab order ahead of the panel body's
    own focusables; Space/Enter toggle it. `ExpandPanelCfg.ColorBorderFocus`
    (theme-backed) paints the ring.
  - `ColorSwatchCfg` gains opt-in `Focusable` and `OnClick`; Space/Enter
    activate a focused swatch like a click. The ring replaces the resting
    outline on the color layer, the same border convention as the other color
    controls.
- **`Colors ColorSet` on eleven more widgets** — `Input`, `NumericInput`,
  `Select`, `Combobox`, `ListBox`, `Tree`, `Slider`, `ContextMenu`, `Menubar`,
  `Table` and `ExpandPanel` now accept the per-state `ColorSet` the six widgets
  of v0.54.0 already used. Additive and zero visual change: the surviving flat
  `Color*` fields still win over the set when both are set (the `applyTo`
  precedence), so existing callers keep their appearance. `ColorSelect` and
  `ColorHighlight`, which have no set slot, stay flat. Inline `ColorSet{...}`
  constructions inside gui/ and gui/datagrid/ resolve at the construction site
  instead of relying on the receiving widget to resolve (issue #342).
- **Named text roles on `Theme`** — `TextStyleSecondary`, `TextStyleLabel`,
  `TextStyleDisabled`, `TextStylePlaceholder`, with matching
  `ThemeCfg.ColorText*` overrides. A widget that wants quiet text now names the
  reason it is quiet and takes the theme's answer, instead of spelling an alpha.
  The values are per-theme and contrast-matched, not one multiplier: alpha
  blends toward the background, and the same alpha that reads as "present but
  quiet" on a dark ground reads as nearly gone on a light one. Polarity is
  derived from the theme's own text and background luminance, so a theme an app
  builds itself gets the right ladder without knowing the roles exist. See
  `docs/specs/widget-visual-consistency-audit.md` (issue #335).
- **`Label` on eight field Cfgs** — `Input`, `Select`, `Combobox`, `Slider`,
  `NumericInput`, `DatePicker`, `InputDate` and `ColorPicker`. One convention,
  decided once: above the field, left-aligned, in the theme's label role. Fills
  `A11YLabel` when that is unset. Additive — an empty `Label` renders exactly as
  before, with no wrapper and no extra shape (issue #335).
- **`Theme.PaddingField` / `ThemeCfg.PaddingField`** — the inset a text-bearing
  form control puts around its text, so controls in one row share a height
  (issue #335).
- **`ListBoxCfg.ColorBorderFocus` and `ListBoxStyle.ColorBorderFocus`** — a
  `ListBox` is focusable and key-navigable and previously drew no focus ring at
  all (issue #335).
- **Golden render tests** (`gui/golden_test.go`, `gui/testdata/`). Builds a
  widget, drives the real frame pipeline, and diffs the emitted `[]RenderCmd`
  against a recording, in both `ThemeDark` and `ThemeLight`. Re-record with
  `go test ./gui/ -run TestGolden -update` after reading the diff.

- **Composable color components.** `ColorPlane` (saturation × lightness),
  `ColorWheel` (hue × saturation), `ColorChannelSlider` (one HSLA channel, with
  a track showing the colors it can pick, horizontal or `Vertical`),
  `ColorSwatch` (a color over a transparency checkerboard) and `ColorFields`
  (hex and channel inputs) are now public widgets. They are stateless: each
  takes a `gui.HSLA` and reports changes, so an app holding one value can drive
  any arrangement of them and they stay in sync. See
  `docs/specs/color-picker-components.md`.
- **`gui.HSLA`**, the color model those components speak, plus `ColorToHSLA`,
  `HSLA.Color`, `HSLA.String` (CSS `hsla()` notation), `Color.Hex` and
  `ColorFromHex`. An app holds an `HSLA` rather than a `Color` because RGBA
  cannot carry hue through a gray or through black.
- **In-memory image registry** — `gui.UseImage`, `HasImage`, `DropImage`,
  `SetMemImageBudget`. Register an NRGBA8 pixel buffer under a content key and
  get a `Src` string usable anywhere `ImageCfg.Src` or `DrawContext.Image` is
  accepted; every backend uploads it as a texture. This is what makes imagery no
  gradient can express — a hue wheel, an HSL plane, an alpha checkerboard —
  drawable at all.

### Changed

- **Spacing tiers now mean relatedness** (issue #344). The four rungs —
  `SpacingTight 2`, `SpacingSmall 5`, `SpacingMedium 10`, `SpacingLarge 15` —
  state what each gaps, documented at the const block in `gui/styles.go` and in
  `docs/style-guide.md`. The tab strip, submenu items and calendar cells fold
  their private `2`/`1`/`2` into `SpacingTight`; the toast stack and
  `RadioButtonGroup`'s default move from `Small` to `Medium` (toasts spread
  8→10, radio options 5→10); markdown block spacing moves 12→15 as the first
  internal caller of `SpacingLarge`. `nestIndent` stays 16 and is documented as
  a structural indent, not a sibling gap.

- **`gui.ColorPicker` is now a composition of the components above.** Its
  `ColorPickerCfg` is unchanged and existing callers compile untouched. Five
  visible changes: the square is the HSL saturation × lightness plane rather
  than the HSV square, the hue and alpha sliders stand vertically to the right
  of the plane instead of stacking beneath it (so the picker is squarer), the
  preview swatch moves next to the hex field it previews, the alpha slider gains
  a real transparency checkerboard, and the hue strip is exact instead of being
  silently resampled to five gradient stops. `ShowHSV` still works and is
  deprecated in favour of `ShowHSL`.

- **Visual: de-emphasized text is unified across widgets** (issue #335). The
  same "disabled text" state used to render at three different alphas — 65 on a
  tab, 127 in an `Input`, 130 on a breadcrumb — because whether the themed value
  got halved again depended on how each widget happened to be built. Disabled
  tab text lightens (65 → 128) and breadcrumb text moves 130 → 128. On the light
  theme every quiet role gains contrast, since the alphas had been copied from
  the dark theme unchanged.
- **Visual: form controls share a height.** `Input`, `Select` and `Combobox`
  each picked their own text inset, so a `Select` rendered six pixels taller
  than the `Input` beside it. All text-bearing controls now take
  `Theme.PaddingField` (issue #335).
- **Visual: `ListBox`, `ColorPlane`, `ColorWheel` and `ColorChannelSlider` show
  focus.** All four take keyboard focus and previously gave no indication of it
  (issue #335).
- **Visual: `Switch` and `Toggle` labels gain the gap `Radio` already had.** The
  three spelled their trailing label three ways; all three now sit the same
  distance from their control (issue #335).
- **Visual: `ColorFields` channel labels** take the theme's label role instead
  of an invented two-step size drop and 0.7 alpha, and the shared spacing tier
  instead of a bespoke 2px gap (issue #335).
- **Visual: vertically-centred text is centred on its ink, not its line box**
  (issue #346). A text shape is sized to the font's full height, so the descent
  it reserves goes unused by text that cannot descend — digits above all — and
  the text reads high. Every vertically-centred control that owns its text now
  corrects for this: `Badge` counts, the progress-bar readout, `Button` and
  everything built on it (tabs, command buttons), menu items, `Select`'s label,
  `ColorFields` channels, date masks and numeric fields. Roughly 1px at 16pt,
  3px at 48pt.

  The correction is deliberately not uniform, because a single rule was tried
  and measured worse: it made badges read right while dropping single-line
  inputs too low. What the text **is** decides the band it is centred on — a
  value on its own ink, a label on the face's cap band, a glyph (icon, step
  triangle, `×`) always on its own ink, and editable text on a band that ignores
  content so the baseline cannot move as the user types. Text the user types
  into an unconstrained control is not corrected at all. See
  `docs/specs/text-optical-centring.md` and the "Vertical centring" section of
  `docs/style-guide.md`.

  No new public API: the opt-ins are internal, so a widget outside `gui/`
  inherits the correction through `Button` and the field widgets but cannot
  request a band of its own. Run `examples/optical_centring/` to see the bands
  side by side at 16/24/48pt.

### Fixed

- **Word motion and double-click select by rune class, not whitespace** (issue
  #329). `Ctrl+Left`/`Ctrl+Right` and double-click treated only space, tab and
  newline as separators, so `foo.bar.baz` was one word, `a+b` was one word, and
  Japanese text had no interior boundaries at all — a word motion jumped the
  whole line and a double-click selected it. A word is now a maximal run of one
  rune class (whitespace, punctuation, word, Han, Hiragana, Katakana), so a
  punctuation run is a word of its own and a script change ends a word.
  Underscore stays a word rune, keeping `snake_case_name` whole, and a combining
  mark stays attached to its base.
  - The rules are go-glyph's, not a second copy: the no-layout path now calls
    `glyph.WordStartLeft`, `glyph.WordStartRight` and
    `glyph.WordBoundsInString`, which apply the same class runs as the `Layout`
    methods the measured path already used. A window with a text measurer and
    one without now segment identically; previously they disagreed even about
    `\n`.
  - `Input` double-click and double-click drag-extend never had a layout path,
    so this is a visible fix there, not only in headless tests.
  - `moveCursorWordRight` now lands on the next word's start rather than past
    the current word's trailing whitespace. Identical for space-separated text.
  - Each `Ctrl+arrow` keypress and each double-click drops one `[]rune`
    conversion; the helpers take the string and convert at the go-glyph
    boundary.

- **Multi-line text sat high in its box, so `ListBox` rows read top-biased.**
  go-glyph sizes a line box as the baseline-to-baseline advance — ascent +
  descent + leading, floored at 1.15em — while rendering puts the baseline at
  `FontAscent` below the shape top. The layout pass took that height verbatim,
  so the leading below the _last_ baseline was reserved at the bottom of every
  multiline or wrapped text shape and nothing ever painted into it: 2.4px at
  size 16, all of it under the text. A text shape is now sized to the
  ascent..descent box the single-line path already uses
  (`(lines-1)*lineHeight + FontHeight`), which is also the box
  `docs/specs/text-optical-centring.md` assumes. Inter-line spacing is
  unchanged; only the trailing leading goes.
- **A virtualized `ListBox` built too few rows to cover its viewport.** The row
  height it virtualizes with was estimated as `1.4 x font size + padding`, which
  over-counted a row by ~30% once a real text measurer was present — a row is
  one text shape (`FontHeight`) plus its padding. Spacers, the visible range and
  the height model `ScrollToIndex` reads all divide by that number, so a tall
  scrolled list left a blank strip along its bottom edge that the two-row
  overscan could not cover. The estimate now asks the measurer, falling back to
  the same approximation the text path itself uses when there is none, and the
  spacers take the caller's number rather than recomputing it. `Combobox`, the
  command palette and `VirtualList` share the estimate and are fixed with it.
- **`Input` undo recorded every keystroke as its own step, evicting the whole
  history after 50 characters** (issue #328). Consecutive edits of the same kind
  — a typing run, a backspace chain — now coalesce into one undo step whose
  anchor is the state before the run began, so Ctrl+Z after typing a sentence
  undoes the sentence, and a long run no longer pushes older history out of the
  50-entry cap. A run breaks on caret motion or click, on a drag selection, on
  paste or any multi-rune insert (IME commits included), on a programmatic text
  set, and on a change of edit kind (typing after backspace and backspace after
  typing are separate steps).
- **`Input` ignored the theme's own padding** (issue #335). `InputStyle.Padding`
  was dead: the widget fell back to a hardcoded inset, so a theme author editing
  it saw `Container` and `ListBox` move while `Input` stayed put. `Input`'s
  inner row also left `SizeBorder` unset and so inherited the theme's container
  border, silently reserving 3px of height for a border it never painted.
- **A live menu item's shortcut hint wore the disabled dim** (issue #335), so an
  enabled item and a dead one rendered identically.
- **`ColorFields`' private optical correction overshot by ~0.04em** — about
  0.7px at 16pt, 2px at 48pt (issue #346). It shifted padding from bottom to
  top, which moves the text by twice the offset, and compensated for a
  half-leading term the line box does not carry: `glyph` reports line gap
  separately from the height a text shape is sized to. Measured ink replaces
  both of its local ratios, and the shared helper is now what every widget
  reaches for.
- **The date-picker calendar read the wall clock directly** to ring today, via
  `time.Now()` rather than the window's clock, so it could not be pinned by a
  test and the golden recording broke on every date rollover (issue #346).
- **`DockLayout`'s close glyph bypassed the theme**, reading a package size
  constant directly, so a theme that shifted its type scale could not move it
  (issue #335).
- **`buildapp` ad-hoc signing silently revoked every TCC grant on each
  rebuild.** The tool hard-coded `codesign -s -`, and an ad-hoc signature
  carries no certificate and no team identifier, so TCC keys its grant on the
  cdhash — which changes every build. Screen recording, microphone, camera,
  accessibility, input monitoring and full disk access were all dropped on every
  `make app`, while the System Settings row survived (that list is keyed by
  bundle id, the authorization check by cdhash), so the permission looked
  granted and the API returned denied. New `-sign <identity>` flag, defaulting
  to `$BUILDAPP_SIGN_IDENTITY` and then to `-`, so existing callers are
  unchanged and anyone with a self-signed code-signing certificate keeps grants
  across rebuilds. The `-bundle-deps` re-sign now reports `codesign`'s own
  output instead of a bare exit status. See `cmd/buildapp/README.md` § Signing
  (issue #303).

## [v0.61.0] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- **go-glyph bumped v1.21.0 → v1.22.0.** Brings `backend/ebitengine` out of the
  root module into its own module (same import path), so ebiten and the `oto/v3`
  audio stack drop out of the dependency graph for every go-gui consumer. Also
  adds a `make prepush` gate on the glyph side.

### Fixed

- **Layout and hero transitions left ID-less descendants behind.**
  `AnimateLayout` only moved shapes that had a snapshot of their own, and layout
  coordinates are absolute, so a sliding container's `Text` (no `ID`, so no
  snapshot) jumped straight to its final position while the container eased
  under it. The walk now carries the nearest interpolated ancestor's position
  delta and applies it to descendants that have no snapshot — the standard FLIP
  subtree shift. A shape with its own snapshot replaces the carried delta rather
  than adding to it, since the snapshot is absolute and already accounts for its
  ancestors. `AnimSnapPos` zeroes the delta for the subtree, so a snapped
  container still holds everything under it still. `HeroTransition` had the
  identical defect — a morphing card travelled without its label — and
  `applyHeroRecursive` now carries the shift by the same rule.

- **`examples/animations`: the seven toolbar buttons all shared one `ID`.** A
  duplicate effective ID is a single identity, and the layout transition
  snapshots by effective ID, so pressing **Layout** made every button lerp from
  whichever button wrote the snapshot last — the toolbar borders visibly slid.
  Each button now keys on its label under a scoping `animations_toolbar` row,
  and `TestMainViewNoDuplicateIDs` asserts the window is clean.

### Added

- **Per-shape snap mask for layout transitions (issue #310).** `AnimateLayout`
  used to be all-or-nothing over the whole window: every ID-bearing shape got X,
  Y, Width and Height lerped, with no way to exclude a channel, a shape or a
  subtree. `Shape.AnimSnap` (and its `ContainerCfg.AnimSnap` write-through, the
  same seam `Hero` uses) now marks channels that snap instead of easing —
  `AnimSnapPos`, `AnimSnapSize`, `AnimSnapAll`. This covers "slide, don't
  stretch" card and grid reflow, and holding a scroll viewport, datagrid body or
  virtualised list still while the surrounding chrome animates. The mask is an
  **opt-out**: the zero value animates every channel the active transition
  covers, so no existing caller changes behaviour. It is OR-inherited down the
  layout walk, so a snapped container snaps its whole subtree and a child cannot
  escape it. The hero transition is unaffected — `Shape.Hero` is already an
  explicit per-shape opt-in. Cost is a `uint8` that lands in existing struct
  padding (`Shape` stays 304 bytes) plus two branches inside a walk that already
  runs.

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `A11YLabel` and `A11YDescription` moved to an embedded `A11YCfg`
  (issue #311).** The two fields were declared independently in 35 `Cfg`
  structs; an AST scan across every `Cfg` shows they are a perfect co-occurrence
  group — 35 carry both, **zero** carry exactly one — so they are now declared
  once and embedded. Behaviour is unchanged: `accessInfo`, `makeA11YInfo`,
  `a11yLabel` and the accessibility tree are untouched, and no test assertion
  moved. Field promotion keeps every **read** and **assignment** spelled exactly
  as before (`cfg.A11YLabel`), but Go has no promoted-field key in a composite
  literal, so code that **sets** either field in a literal must name the embed:

  ```go
  // before
  gui.ButtonCfg{ID: "save", A11YLabel: "Save"}
  // after
  gui.ButtonCfg{ID: "save", A11YCfg: gui.A11YCfg{A11YLabel: "Save"}}
  ```

  `A11YRole` and `A11YState` are unaffected — only `ButtonCfg` and
  `ContainerCfg` carry those, which is far short of a group worth embedding. The
  new `A11YCfg.a11yInfo(fallback)` method gives the recurring
  `makeA11YInfo(a11yLabel(cfg.A11YLabel, X), cfg.A11YDescription)` pairing a
  home; it is a wrapper, and both helpers stay as they were.

### Fixed

- **The check mark now sits in the middle of the checkbox.** `Toggle` (and its
  `Checkbox` alias) centred the check on the font's advance box, which spans the
  descent the glyph never paints into and each side bearing, so the check
  floated above centre — barely at the default size, glaringly on a large one.
  It is now centred on its ink: the backend measures the glyph's painted box
  (new go-glyph `InkBounds`) and `AmendLayout` moves the arranged glyph, so
  nothing about sizing, draw order, or the widget tree changes. Backends without
  the capability, and tests with no measurer, keep the previous advance-box
  centring. The toggle theme style's padding is symmetric again, its left-heavy
  value having been a partial nudge for the same defect. The same correction now
  applies wherever a single glyph is centred inside a drawn frame: the markdown
  task-list checkbox and the splitter's collapse buttons.

## [v0.60.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Per-window themes (issue #296).** A `Window` now owns its theme.
  `w.SetTheme(t)` themes that window alone and `w.Theme()` reads it back;
  windows that never pin one follow the app default, which package-level
  `gui.SetTheme` still sets. The frame pass installs the active window's theme
  before the view function runs, so widget factories keep resolving their
  defaults exactly as before — no factory signature changed, no allocation was
  added, and existing single-window code behaves identically. See
  `docs/specs/per-window-theme.md`.

- **`gui.Themed(t, build)` scopes a theme to one subtree.** Views the builder
  returns resolve their defaults from `t`; everything outside keeps the window's
  theme, and `Themed` nests. The builder runs at layout-generation time, which
  is what makes the scope work: factories resolve defaults when they are called,
  so ready-made child views would already carry the enclosing theme.

### Changed

- **`View` is now a single method — `GenerateLayout(*Window) Layout`
  (breaking).** `View.Content() []View` is gone. The 24 container and composite
  widgets that built child trees in `Content()` now build them in
  `GenerateLayout` and hand them to `appendChildViews`, which owns the child
  walk, the event-children cap, the scratch-arena reservation and the ID-scope
  push/restore — one mechanism instead of two, with identical behavior and
  allocations (flat_100 100, nested_3x10 100, deep_12x1 1). `*Layout` does not
  implement `View`; `ContainerCfg.Content` remains a plain field. Sibling
  consumers migrate in lockstep: go-charts records its gallery charts at build
  time (go-charts#41), go-map and go-term drop their `Content()`
  implementations. See `docs/specs/view-single-method.md`.

- **The default appearance changed: `ThemeMaker` is now the only source of
  widget styling (issue #300).** Go-Gui carried two sets of defaults — about 30
  `default*Style` literals in `styles*.go`, and `ThemeDark` — and they had
  drifted apart. Because `init` never installed a theme, an app that never
  called `SetTheme` ran on a mixture of the two, and switching themes once
  restyled it. The literals are gone; `init` installs `ThemeDark`.

  Every widget now looks the way it already did after any theme switch. The
  visible differences from the old fresh-app look:

  - Buttons, inputs, containers, dialogs, toasts, tooltips, expand panels,
    selects, trees, switches, toggles, tab controls, date pickers, color
    pickers, menubars, splitters, the command palette, comboboxes and listboxes
    lose their 1.5px border. Sliders lose 1px, radios 2px. `ThemeDark` is
    borderless by design; bordered is the separate `dark-bordered` preset.
  - The **data grid gains its styling**. Its literal was an unstyled placeholder
    with zero colors, so an unthemed datagrid rendered flat.
  - Inputs and listboxes take the theme's medium padding (10 rather than 5/6),
    so they are slightly taller.
  - Badges turn grey with bold white text instead of blue with unstyled text.
  - Dialogs gain 200/300 width bounds; toast titles are no longer bold; the
    button click color, input/switch/toggle focus colors, toggle radius, submenu
    spacing, command-palette detail color and input spell-error color all move
    to their `ThemeDark` values.
  - `NumericInput` and `RadioButtonGroup` follow the active theme. Both had a
    private hard-coded 1.5px border that no theme could reach, light included.

  To keep the previous look, install the bordered variant:

  ```go
  gui.SetTheme(gui.ThemeDark.WithBorders(true))
  ```

  See `docs/specs/theme-style-single-source.md`.

### Fixed

- **Post-generation code now reads the theme of the window it is acting on
  (issue #301).** Event handlers, post-arrange work and the backends resolved
  the theme from the frame-scoped cache, which holds whichever window generated
  last — correct in a one-window app, wrong with two. Thirteen such sites now
  call `w.Theme()`: the scroll and key-scroll paths, print export, the theme
  picker's highlight sync (visibly wrong before), toast max-visible, the select
  dropdown scroll, the inspector wireframe, and every backend's clear color.
  Widget factories and `GenerateLayout` are unchanged and keep the bare read,
  which is what makes `gui.Themed` subtree scoping work. The window and app
  theme stores now hold a pointer to an immutable value, so the per-event reads
  do not copy a struct holding ~40 style structs (the scroll benchmark stays at
  ~39 ns/op, 0 allocs); `w.Theme()` still returns a value and is unchanged for
  callers. A new `make ergonomics-audit` mode (`theme`) gates the
  post-generation paths. See `docs/specs/per-window-theme.md`.

- **Theme-keyed text caches no longer serve stale layouts.** The per-window
  markdown and rich-text layout caches invalidated on `Theme.Name`; two themes
  can share a name and differ in text styles, as a derived or scoped theme does.
  Both now key on a stamped theme identity.

- **The datagrid column-resize handle now renders its active color during a
  resize drag (issue #284).** A drag holds a mouse lock and `layoutHover` bails
  under a lock, so the handle's pressed color — painted only from `OnHover` —
  could not fire mid-drag and the handle showed its resting color while
  resizing. The handle's color now comes from the resize state read at
  generation time (`dataGridActiveResizeColID`), live for the whole drag and
  reverting on release or cancel.

- **Pressed-while-hovered colors now render.** Seven `OnHover` handlers paint a
  click color while the left button is held (button `Colors.Click`, breadcrumb
  crumb, expand-panel header, switch pill, toggle, radio, datagrid resize
  handle), but no frame could reach those branches: `layoutHover` synthesized
  its event with `MouseButton: MouseInvalid` no matter what the user was
  holding. The window now reports the real held button in hover events (see
  Changed below), so a press-and-hold renders the click color and release
  restores the hover color.

- **Interrupted (capture-loss) selection drags no longer leave a stuck selection
  (issue #281).** Input, Text and RTF selection drags hold a mouse lock whose
  `Cancel` hook fired on capture loss — a mouse-up that will never arrive
  (window-resize steal, alt-tab, the #237 class) — but only removed the
  edge-scroll animation; the partial selection survived as if committed. The
  three Cancel hooks now zero the dragged widget's own `selectBeg`/`selectEnd`
  (scoped to its `nsInput` key, never other widgets'), so an interrupted drag
  leaves nothing. A normal release still commits even outside the widget — the
  lock delivers the mouse-up anywhere; only capture loss goes through the Cancel
  hook.

- **Re-asserting focus no longer clears input selections (issue #277).**
  `setFocusLocked` called `clearInputSelections()` on every `SetFocus`,
  unconditionally, while the IME clear next to it was already guarded by
  `id != prev` (#156). Because consumers legitimately re-assert focus from
  inside their View function — which runs on every layout rebuild — an
  unconditional clear wiped every `nsInput` selection window-wide on each
  re-assert, silently dropping selections in the focused input and every
  unrelated field. The clear is now guarded exactly like the IME clear: only a
  real focus change drops selections (window-wide, as before); a same-widget
  re-assert leaves them alone. Clicking an already-focused input still collapses
  its selection to a caret at the click — that path sets the selection itself
  and never depended on the clear.

- **Markdown/RTF in-document anchor links (`#slug`) now scroll (issue #278).**
  `rtfOnClick` scrolled the bare slug, but a heading's ID is scoped to its
  document (`ScopeID(docID, "h", slug)` — e.g. `md:h:slug`, or `panel:md:h:slug`
  nested), so `FindByID(slug)` missed and the scroll silently no-opped — even at
  root. The `#` branch now resolves through `rtfResolveAnchor`: for a markdown
  block (every block carries the document's effective ID in `TC.markdownID`, now
  stamped on non-focusable documents too), the document-scoped heading spelling
  is tried first, then the bare slug — so arbitrary absolute targets
  (`#view:bottom`) and standalone RTF links keep working. The identity stamping
  and the selection machinery are separate flags now: a non-focusable markdown
  document gains anchor resolution but keeps its exact prior click behavior (no
  focus, no mouse lock, no per-frame selection walk).

- **Markdown: cross-block selection works under ID-bearing ancestors (issue
  #273).** The document's blocks were stamped with the raw `cfg.ID` at
  generation time, while the container's amend and key handlers keyed on the
  _effective_ ID the resolve pass stamps — so a markdown nested in a panel with
  an ID collected an empty block list (`nsMdBlocks` was keyed `panel:md`, the
  blocks matched `md`), and cross-block drag, Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C and click focus
  were dead, with the click writing selection state under a key nothing read.
  `Markdown` is now a struct view whose `GenerateLayout` resolves the effective
  ID once (`w.EffID(cfg.ID)`, the same mechanism the splitter uses) and stamps
  it into every block and inner ID, so the container, the blocks, the state
  slots and `SetFocus` all agree on one identity. Flat documents are unchanged;
  two documents sharing a leaf under different panels now keep separate
  selections.

- **Markdown: a stale selection no longer survives a document content change
  (issue #275).** `markdownContainerAmendLayout` now hashes the block list
  (offsets, rune counts, flat text) each frame and resets the per-widget
  selection when the hash changes: `SelBeg`/`SelEnd` are rune offsets into the
  _previous_ source, so a stale range would highlight — and Ctrl+C would copy —
  the wrong runes of the new text. A same-length rewrite of the document is
  caught too; a pure layout change (resize, font) leaves the selection alone.

### Changed

- **`OnHover` receives the held mouse button.** The window tracks the held
  button from its own event stream — set on `EventMouseDown`, cleared on
  `EventMouseUp` and `MouseCancel` — and `layoutHover` reports it in the
  synthesized hover event: `MouseLeft`/`MouseRight`/`MouseMiddle` while held,
  `MouseInvalid` when none is held. A hover handler can now distinguish a
  press-and-hold from a plain hover; it could not before, because the event
  always arrived with `MouseInvalid`. The event is still `Type: EventMouseMove`
  and is rebuilt field-by-field every frame.

- **`Theme.WithInspectorStyle` is unexported (breaking; no known consumers).**
  It was the only exported member of the `with*Style` family and was carried on
  an `exportaudit:keep` claim of sibling-repo use that does not exist. It is now
  `withInspectorStyle`, matching `withDataGridStyle` and the rest of the family.
  This completes the issue #288 API-surface review: with all sibling repos
  scanned, the authoritative audit reports a clean surface — one `none` export
  (`FillBorder`, intentionally public, showcase-documented) and every
  self/selftest-only export carries a justified keep marker.

### Added

- **Markdown interaction test suite expands to the nested-document and
  source-change cases** (`gui/markdown_select_interaction_test.go`):
  effective-ID block collection, click focus, Ctrl+A/C, cross-block drag and
  per-panel isolation under ID-bearing ancestors; offset-block click accuracy
  (the click handlers receive shape-relative coordinates via `callRelative`, so
  a click maps to the rune under the cursor wherever the block sits); and
  selection reset on content change with an idle-frame positive control. Plus
  diagram-cache async tests (`gui/markdown_diagram_fetch_test.go`) and
  block-renderer tests (`gui/view_markdown_blocks_test.go`). Package `gui/`
  moves from 81.0% to 82.4%.

- **FillFill roots on axis-less containers resolve to the window size (issue
  #262).** `updateLayoutLocked` pins a Fill root to the window dimensions via
  `Min = Max`, but the width/height sizing passes only consulted the pin on
  axis-bearing containers — so a `Splitter` (built on a `Canvas`) returned
  directly as the root view resolved to 0x0 and was invisible, despite `Sizing`
  defaulting to `FillFill`. The `axisNone` branch of both passes now honors
  explicit min/max pins, so `FillFill` is honest on axis-less roots and tracks
  window resize. It also makes an explicit `MinWidth`/`MaxWidth` on a
  `Fit`-sized `Canvas` take effect, which is the documented intent of those
  fields (Fill roots keep the window pin; the fill distribution clamps nested
  Fill children). Children of axis-less containers keep their sizing semantics
  unchanged.

- **Splitter: a collapsed pane with content now reaches its collapsed size
  (issue #263).** `splitterLayoutChild` pinned the pane to the size
  `splitterCompute` decided, then re-ran the fit passes, which recomputed the
  pane from its content's minimum and overwrote the pin — so a pane holding real
  content kept a sliver that drew underneath the handle. The pin is now
  re-applied after the fit passes, so collapse is exact (zero-width with the
  default `collapsedSize`, or exactly `collapsedSize` when set). Contract note:
  pane sizes come from ratio/min/max only; content larger than the computed pane
  size is clipped (panes have `Clip: true`), never stretches the pane.
- **Splitter: the spacebar toggles collapse again.** `splitterOnKeydown` tested
  `Event.CharCode`, which backends populate only on `EventChar` — a space
  keydown arrives with `KeyCode == KeySpace` and `CharCode == 0`, so the branch
  never fired. Now reads `KeyCode`, matching `DatePicker`, `Tree`, `Menu` and
  `Select`.
- **Breadcrumb and TabControl: the spacebar activates again.** Both had the same
  defect — `bcOnKeydown` and `tabControlOnKeydown` tested `Event.CharCode` from
  an `OnKeyDown` handler, so space never selected the focused crumb or tab. Both
  now read `KeyCode == KeySpace`, grouped with the identical `KeyEnter` branch.
  `Splitter`, `Breadcrumb` and `TabControl` were the only three sites with this
  defect; every other `CharCode` reader in `gui/` is an `OnChar` handler, where
  the field is populated.
- **Splitter: `SplitterStyle`'s border and radius reach the handle.**
  `applySplitterDefaults` seeded every color from the style but skipped
  `SizeBorder`, `Radius` and `radiusBorder`, so the handle and the collapse
  buttons fell through to the generic container and button defaults. Visible
  change under the stock theme: corner radius on both goes from `radiusMedium`
  (5.5) to the splitter's `radiusSmall` (3.5) — the border width was already
  `sizeBorderDef` either way. For a custom theme the splitter's own three values
  were dead and now apply. An explicit `SomeF(0)` still means "no border".
- **Splitter: part IDs now scope with the root (issue #264).** `Splitter`
  composed its pane, handle and collapse-button IDs in the factory, where no
  `Window` exists, so under an ID-bearing ancestor the root resolved to
  `outer:sp` while every part stayed window-global (`sp:handle`, …) — two
  splitters reusing one leaf ID collided on every part. The splitter is now a
  struct view whose `GenerateLayout` resolves the effective ID
  (`w.EffID(cfg.ID)`) and composes every part under that path. With no
  ID-bearing ancestor the spellings are unchanged. API consequence: parts of a
  nested splitter are addressed by scoped effective IDs (`outer:sp:handle`,
  `outer:sp:pane:first`).
- **Splitter: the handle's active (button-held) color now renders during a drag
  (issue #265).** `splitterOnHandleHover` painted `colorHandleActive` only while
  `Event.MouseButton == MouseLeft` — a branch no real frame could reach, because
  `layoutHover` bails while the mouse is locked (and a splitter drag runs under
  `MouseLock`) and always synthesizes hover events with
  `MouseButton: MouseInvalid`. The active color is now driven from the
  splitter's own drag state instead: the press paints the handle immediately and
  records a pressed flag in window state, and `splitterAmendLayout` re-paints
  the active color every frame while the lock is held, so the pressed feedback
  survives the per-frame regeneration of the handle. The flag is cleared on
  release and by the mouse lock's `Cancel` hook, and the amend paint is
  additionally guarded by the window's actual lock state, so capture lost
  without a release (issue #237) can never leave the handle permanently active.

### Added

- **Splitter interaction test suite** (`gui/view_splitter_interaction_test.go`):
  AmendLayout geometry, drag resize through the mouse lock, hover, the keyboard
  map, and the collapse buttons. Both splitter files reach 100% statement
  coverage; package `gui/` moves from 79.8% to 81.0%.

## [v0.59.2] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- **go-glyph bumped to v1.20.2** — the face LRU now idle-evicts and the fallback
  cache evicts FIFO, so long sessions release font memory without new face
  churn; single-codepoint emoji fallback is decided from cmap coverage alone (PR
  #266).

## [v0.59.1] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- **GL backend tests now run cgo-free** to dodge a runtime exit crash on macOS
  (issue #162, PR #257).
- **`make` gates match golangci-lint's version string** without assuming a `v`
  prefix (PR #258), fixing local runs against newer linter releases.

### Changed

- **go-glyph bumped to v1.20.1** — the face LRU is byte-budgeted, capping
  resident memory from a single typeface (PR #260).

## [v0.59.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- **`Sizing` self-flags like `Padding`/`Color` (#243, #254).** `Sizing` carries
  a `set` field: the zero value (`FitFit`) is a real combination, so the flag is
  what distinguishes "unset" from an explicit `Sizing{FitFit}`. Predefined vars
  (`FitFit`…`FillFixed`) set it; read with `IsSet()`/`Or()`. The raw
  `Sizing{...}` literal now reads as unset (ergoaudit literals mode flags it).
  `DataGridCfg.Sizing` drops `Opt[gg.Sizing]` for plain `gg.Sizing` (breaking).
  An explicit `FitFit` + wrap mode in text is no longer clobbered to `FillFit`.

### Changed

- **Async present outside live resize on macOS Metal (#255).** During live
  window resize the Metal backend now presents asynchronously, decoupling
  presentation from the resize hot path instead of blocking on the drawable.
  Reduced jank and dropped frames while resizing.

## [v0.58.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- **`scripts/dev-loop.sh` rebuild-and-relaunch wrapper (#218).** Watches the
  module for `*.go`/`go.mod`/`go.sum` changes, rebuilds into the gitignored
  `build/dev-loop/`, kills the running app and relaunches it with preserved
  args. Build failures print loudly and keep the watcher and the last good
  binary running; INT/TERM/EXIT traps clean up the app and artifacts. Documented
  in `docs/dev-loop.md`, linked from `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

- **`TextStyle.CellWidth`, `TextStyle.CellHeight` and
  `TextStyle.NoBuiltinBoxGlyphs` (#251).** go-glyph draws box-drawing
  (U+2500–257F) and block-element (U+2580–259F) characters procedurally at cell
  size instead of through the font. Without a cell it derives one from the glyph
  advance and the run's ascent+descent, which fixes the stroke weight and the
  sub-pixel phase but leaves a sub-pixel overlap wherever the advance is
  fractional. Grid callers (terminals) build a `gui.TextStyle`, never a
  `glyph.TextStyle`, so they had no way to pass their real cell: setting
  `CellWidth`/`CellHeight` is what makes neighbouring cells abut exactly.
  `NoBuiltinBoxGlyphs` keeps the font's own glyphs instead. All three map
  through both converters — the rich-text path (`toGlyphStyle`) and the
  plain-text measure/render path (`glyphconv.GuiStyleToGlyphConfig`), which is
  what `TermGrid` renders through. Zero/false keep today's behaviour.

## [v0.57.0] - 2026-08-10

### Changed

- **`Padding` self-flags; `Opt[Padding]` and `SomeP` removed (breaking, #243).**
  `Padding` carries a `set` flag like `Color`: the zero value is "unset" (theme
  default applies), `PaddingNone` is an explicitly-set zero, and values are
  built with `NewPadding` / `PadAll` / `PaddingNone`. `IsSet()` and `Or(def)`
  replace `Opt[Padding]`'s `IsSet()`/`Get(def)` on the 50 affected Cfg fields;
  read sites moved from `.Get(Padding{})` to `.Or(PaddingNone)`. Raw
  `Padding{...}` or `Color{...}` literals read as unset, so
  `make ergonomics-audit` now also runs the new `-mode literals` gate over the
  whole tree (defining files and the empty `Color{}` sentinel exempt);
  `-mode opt` exempts Padding-typed fields like it exempts Color. `ThemeMaker`
  stamps the flag on its `cfg.Padding*` copies so a resolved theme value never
  reads as unset. Breaking for consumers of `SomeP` and `Opt[Padding]`:
  go-charts, go-edit, go-kite, go-map and go-term bump together.

- **Exported API surface reduced (~1,400 symbols) as the v1.0 freeze
  (breaking).** `tools/exportaudit` classifies every export in `gui/` by who
  references it — sibling repos (consumers), examples, tests, other gui
  packages, or nothing — and its sweep mode unexported everything referenced
  only inside its own package, its tests, or nowhere at all. Internal helpers,
  dead constants, and swept types are now lowercase. `make export-audit` gates
  the surface: any export whose references stay inside `gui/` fails unless
  marked `// exportaudit:keep`, and the marker explains why (json reflection,
  stdlib interface conformance, same-name collisions, signature reachability).
  Cross-package plumbing (gui/backend ↔ gui) is deferred and reported as
  advisory. 449 files changed; consumers at v0.56.0 are unaffected unless they
  referenced internal-only names.

### Fixed

- **Windows: window and tray icons now render (#235).** `hicon.FromPNG` passed a
  NULL `hbmMask` to `CreateIconIndirect`, which Win32 requires — the call always
  failed, so the title bar, taskbar, alt-tab, and SNI tray icons fell back to
  the shell's generic icon whether or not the app set `WindowCfg.IconPNG`. The
  function now creates a zeroed 1bpp mask (fully opaque), letting the 32bpp
  color bitmap's alpha shape the icon, so Windows honors `IconPNG` like the
  other platforms.

- **Windows: a revoked mouse capture no longer leaves a drag stuck (#110).**
  Win32 can take capture away without ever sending the matching button-up — a
  system modal or UAC prompt, Ctrl+Alt+Del, Win+L, another process calling
  `SetCapture`, a debugger breaking in. `WM_CAPTURECHANGED` was unhandled, so
  the `MouseLock` never cleared and every later mouse move kept driving the drag
  with no button held (text selection tracking the cursor, a splitter or slider
  still following it). The message now cancels the drag. Our own
  `ReleaseCapture` raises the same message, so the backend tracks capture
  ownership and only cancels on an involuntary loss.

### Added

- **`MouseLockCfg.Cancel`** — a `func(*Window)` hook that unwinds a drag ending
  without a release. `MouseUp` cannot serve: it _commits_, so synthesising one
  on capture loss would dock a panel or reorder a list the user never dropped.
  `(*Window).MouseCancel` unlocks and runs the hook; widgets whose state is just
  the lock need no hook. Wired for text/RTF/input selection (stops the
  edge-scroll animation), sliders, the color picker, datagrid column resize,
  dock drags, and drag-reorder.

- **`make export-audit` now actually fails the build when the gate trips.** The
  authoritative consumer scan previously ran under `|| true`, so a real gate
  failure (offenders found with siblings present) exited zero. It now only
  tolerates missing sibling repos; CI shallow-clones the five consumers into
  `../` and runs the authoritative scan, so the freeze is enforced on every PR.
  See `docs/specs/exportaudit-surface-policy.md` for the accepted
  `internal`-class policy.

## [v0.56.0] - 2026-08-09

### Changed

- **Widget IDs are per-scope, not window-global (breaking).** `Shape.ID` is now
  a **leaf**; the identity every store and lookup keys on is the **effective
  ID** — the leaf joined to the IDs of its ID-bearing ancestors. Two panels may
  each hold `Input{ID: "name"}`; they resolve to `settings:name` and
  `profile:name` and keep separate focus, scroll, hover and per-widget state.
  Only explicit ancestor IDs join — never tree position, never a child index —
  so identity survives a reorder and changes only when an app changes an
  ancestor's ID. A leaf that already contains `:` is **absolute** and is left
  alone, which is why existing `ScopeID` composites keep working.

  **Semantic break:** `SetFocus`, `ScrollVerticalTo`, `FindByID`, `IsFocus`, and
  the `Test*` helpers take the effective ID. A call that passes a bare leaf
  stops matching as soon as an ancestor of that widget carries an ID — pass the
  full path (`"settings:name"`). Signatures are unchanged, so the compiler will
  not find these; `(*Window).TestDuplicateIDs` and `GOGUI_DEBUG=1` report the
  identities a frame actually has. `gui/datagrid` is unchanged: its children are
  absolute multi-part IDs by design (a header cell's column is recovered by
  reverse-parsing its ID), so two grids sharing a `cfg.ID` still collide. See
  `docs/specs/widget-id-per-scope-uniqueness.md`.

  Identity resolution is allocation-neutral: the joins are memoized per window,
  so `BenchmarkViewFrame` holds its previous allocs/op. `Shape` itself grew by
  one string (280 → 296 bytes), which crosses a size class and costs 32 bytes
  per shape.

- **Framework-internal identities are absolute.** The inspector tree
  (`gui:inspector:tree`), the RTF link menu (`gui:rtf:link_menu`) and the
  dialog's focus ID are written from event handlers, outside layout generation,
  so they cannot be resolved against the tree they are mounted in. They now
  carry `:` and are therefore their own identity wherever they are mounted.
  Without this the inspector's wireframe followed a pick while its tree never
  selected the row, and dialog focus landed on nothing.

- **Accessibility labels announce a name, not a path.** Where a widget falls
  back to its ID for `A11YLabel`, only the last segment is announced —
  `settings:name` is read as "name". An explicit `A11YLabel` is untouched,
  including one containing a colon.

### Added

- **`(*Window).EffID` and `EventCtx.EffID`.** Resolve a leaf ID to the identity
  the framework's stores use. `w.EffID(cfg.ID)` is for a widget that reads its
  own state _during_ `GenerateLayout` — a combobox's open flag decides the
  subtree it returns, so it cannot wait for the resolve pass. `ctx.EffID(leaf)`
  is for a factory that builds its tree eagerly, with no `Window` in hand
  (`Input`), and resolves against the shape the event is on.

- **`gui.DebugUnscopedIDs`.** Opt-in dev-mode category reporting a focusable or
  scrollable widget with no ID-bearing ancestor — its leaf is still a
  window-global name, so it cannot be reused elsewhere in the window.
  Deliberately outside `DebugAll`: it reports a design property, not a defect.
  Enable with `gui.DebugCategories(gui.DebugUnscopedIDs)`.

- **`gui.ScopeID` and `gui.ScopeIDN`.** The one way to compose an inner widget's
  ID. An ID is now a `:`-joined path (`grid:header:name:resize`); the owner may
  itself be composed, and composition is associative. `ScopeIDN` appends a
  numeric last segment without materialising the number as its own string, for
  loop-derived identity (a list row, a calendar day, a radio option). Both cost
  exactly one allocation, asserted with `testing.AllocsPerRun`. They replace ~70
  hand-rolled concatenations that used five different separators. There is no
  escaping: a **part** — a row key, a heading slug, any leaf value fed into a
  composition — must not contain `:` and keeps its own spelling. See
  `docs/specs/widget-id-scoping.md`.

- **`ergoaudit -mode ids`.** Part of `make ergo-audit`; fails on any hand-rolled
  ID composition in `gui/`. It flags both producers and, importantly, consumers
  — `w.IsFocus(cfg.ID+"_popup")` rebuilds an ID the producer may have moved, and
  that is how the two drift. Exempt a line with `ergoaudit:id-part` (a leaf
  part) or `ergoaudit:not-an-id` (not a widget ID at all).

- **`(*Window).TestDuplicateIDs`.** The assertable form of what `GOGUI_DEBUG=1`
  prints: renders the window and returns every identity defect in the frame —
  duplicate IDs, and ID-less shapes whose focus, scroll, or `OnMouseLeave`
  silently does nothing. Unlike `TestUnconsumedEvents` it dispatches nothing and
  fires no callbacks, so it is safe on a window an assertion still depends on.
  It sees the window as rendered, so drive the app into each state and check
  again.

- **`ErrTestNoScrollRoom`.** `TestScroll` on a scroll container whose content
  already fits now says so, instead of returning the generic `ErrTestUnhandled`.
  The two conditions call for opposite fixes — one means the fixture never had
  anything to scroll, the other means the container is real but already pinned
  at its limit — and the message carries the content and viewport sizes that
  decided it.

### Changed

- **Composed widget IDs are respelled with a single `:` separator.** Every
  framework-composed inner ID changed. Nothing in the public API changed —
  `SetFocus`, `ScrollVerticalTo`, `FindByID` and the test helpers still take the
  whole composed string — but an application that hardcoded one of these
  spellings (most likely in its own tests) must update it. There is no compile
  error for that; the symptom is a test that no longer finds its widget.

  Dock node IDs are generated during drag-drop and stored in `DockNode`, which
  an application may persist. Nothing parses them, so an old saved layout keeps
  working — it simply carries old-format IDs alongside newly minted ones.

  Unchanged: everything already spelled with `:` (`cmdbtn:`, `dock_close:`,
  datagrid cells and headers, splitter handles, scroll IDs), and data-derived
  row keys (`__auto_`, `__draft_`, `__src_o_`), which are parts rather than
  scopes.

### Fixed

- **Two `Markdown` widgets in one window no longer share IDs.** A heading's ID
  was its bare anchor slug, a code block's copy button was keyed by block index
  alone, and the document-level copy button was the constant `md_cp_doc` — so
  two documents in one window collided on all three. All are now scoped to the
  document. Two identical headings in a _single_ document still collide, but the
  duplicate audit now reports that instead of letting it pass silently.

- **Composite widgets no longer duplicate their own ID.** `Input` put `cfg.ID`
  on both its outer container and its inner text shape, and every `Markdown`
  paragraph claimed the markdown widget's ID — so a `GOGUI_DEBUG=1` run of a
  normal application drowned in duplicate-ID reports it could do nothing about,
  and the check could not be trusted to mean anything. An inner shape that needs
  the owning widget's focus and spell-check state now references it instead of
  claiming its identity, and a markdown document's container owns the ID while
  its blocks are tied to it through the existing markdown selection key.
  `FindByID` on a markdown ID now resolves to the container rather than to the
  first paragraph. `ID` is once again an identity that is unique per window.
  Rationale and the remaining ergonomics question:
  `docs/specs/widget-id-scoping.md`.

- **`Markdown` document selection works.** Giving the markdown container the
  widget's ID also fixed a latent defect: the container carried no ID at all,
  and both its selection hook and its key handler bail out on an empty one — so
  drag-selection across blocks, `Ctrl+A` and `Ctrl+C` were dead on every
  `Focusable` markdown document.

- **Wrapped text has a plausible height in headless tests.** Text is not
  zero-sized without a `TextMeasurer` — the width falls back to `0.6em` per rune
  — but the post-sizing pass that turns a paragraph into N lines bailed out, so
  wrapped text kept its one-line seed however much text it held. A scroll
  container around a wall of text therefore never overflowed, and `TestScroll`
  failed for a reason that had nothing to do with the widget under test. Heights
  are now estimated from the same per-rune approximation. Still an estimate:
  assert on structure and overflow, not on pixels.

- `examples/scroll_demo` now asserts that its panel scrolls and that the
  percentage buttons move it, the conversion §4.8 of
  `docs/specs/developer-ergonomics.md` attempted and abandoned.

## [v0.55.0] - 2026-08-08

### Changed

- **BREAKING: one event rule. Nothing is marked handled for you.** A callback
  that acts on an event calls `ctx.Consume()`; a callback that does not, lets
  the event travel on. This is now true of every callback, closing §4.3b of
  `docs/specs/developer-ergonomics.md` — the last open item in that spec.

  Until now `OnClick`, `OnChar`, `OnMouseUp`, `OnGesture` and `OnFileDrop` were
  "consume-class": dispatch marked their events handled _before_ the callback
  ran, and the callback opted out with `ctx.Bubble()`. Everything else consumed
  explicitly. Which of the two you had written was invisible in the signature.

  ```go
  // Before — the pre-mark absorbed the click
  OnClick: func(ctx gui.EventCtx) {
      dismiss(ctx.Window)
  },

  // After
  OnClick: func(ctx gui.EventCtx) {
      dismiss(ctx.Window)
      ctx.Consume()
  },
  ```

- **BREAKING: `EventCtx.Bubble()` is deleted.** Declining is what saying nothing
  already means. Every call site is a compile error; deleting the call is the
  fix.

- **BREAKING: `(*Window).TestEventCollapse` is now `TestUnconsumedEvents`.** It
  measured the cost of a collapse that has since happened. It now reports
  handlers that act without consuming while an ancestor would also receive the
  event, and `gui.Debug(true)` reports the same as they dispatch.

**Upgrading.** The compile-time half is loud — `Bubble()` disappears. The other
half is silent, so search for **empty** consume-class handlers: an `OnClick`
with an empty body used to be a working click-blocker, and now blocks nothing.
Overlays, backdrops, popups and cards that stop clicks reaching what they cover
all need a real `ctx.Consume()`. Four of the five handlers this change broke
inside go-gui were exactly that. `docs/migration-eventctx.md` has the full
guide; `TestUnconsumedEvents` sweeps a window for the rest.

Also in this release, as precursors: 14 sites across 12 files that wrote
`ctx.Event.IsHandled = true` now call `ctx.Consume()`, the unconsumed-event
check counts focus-stealing ancestors (a focusable ancestor takes focus on an
unconsumed click, with no `OnClick` involved anywhere), and
`examples/scroll_demo` no longer gives five buttons the same ID.

## [v0.54.0] - 2026-08-08

Developer-ergonomics phases 2–5 (`docs/specs/developer-ergonomics.md`), shipped
as PRs #195–#202. This completes the spec: every phase is now on `main`.

**This release is breaking**, in three ways, all mechanical:

1. **17 event callbacks take an `EventCtx`** instead of a trailing `*Window`,
   and four no longer leak a raw `*Event`.
2. **`RtfCfg` is now `RTFCfg`**, along with the `Rtf*` fields on `Shape.TC`.
3. **The five flat state-color fields are deleted from six `Cfg`s** and replaced
   by one `Colors ColorSet`.

**Upgrading:** each item under _Changed_ carries its own before/after. The
`EventCtx` conversion has a tool — `docs/migration-eventctx.md` documents the
`-fields` mode that drove it. The color change is the one to read carefully:
`Color` still means "resting fill only" and does **not** pin hover, click and
focus; `Flat(c)` is how you ask for a widget that does not react.

Everything else — the app-testing API, `ColorSet` itself, the event-collapse
check and the example audit — is additive.

### Changed

- **BREAKING: 17 event callbacks now take an `EventCtx`** instead of a trailing
  `*Window`, and the four that leaked a raw `*Event` no longer do. The affected
  fields are `OnAction`, `OnChange`, `OnColumnPinChange`, `OnCopyRows`,
  `OnItemClick`, `OnLayoutChange`, `OnPanelClose`, `OnPanelSelect`, `OnReorder`,
  `OnReset`, `OnSelect`, `OnSubmit`, `OnTextCommit`, `OnToggle` and
  `OnValueCommit`.

  The rule is uniform: `EventCtx` replaces the `*Layout`, `*Event` and `*Window`
  parameters and lands last, while payloads keep their order and results are
  untouched. So `TableCfg.OnSelect func(map[int]bool, int, *Event, *Window)`
  becomes `func(map[int]bool, int, EventCtx)`, and `GridCfg.OnCopyRows` becomes
  `func([]GridRow, EventCtx) (string, bool)` — returning a value was never a
  reason to keep the old shape.

  This finishes what the v0.52.0 `EventCtx` refactor started. Of the 30 distinct
  signatures still carrying a `*Window` or a raw `*Event`, 17 converted; the
  remaining 13 are deliberate. Twelve fire from a timer tick, a dialog
  completion or a lifecycle transition (`OnInit`, `OnCloseRequest`, `OnOkYes`,
  `OnCancelNo`, `OnDismiss`, `OnReply`, `OnLazyLoad`, `OnValue`, four `OnDone`
  variants) — **there is no event** at those points, and handing them an
  `EventCtx` would promise a permanently-nil `ctx.Event`. The thirteenth,
  `Window.OnEvent`, is a raw escape hatch by design.

  Where a widget dispatches one of these from inside an already-converted
  callback, the full context is now passed through rather than a synthesized
  one, so `OnPanelClose` and friends receive the layout they fire from —
  strictly more than the old `*Window` carried.

  Migration: `docs/migration-eventctx.md`, including the new `-fields` mode that
  drove this round. No sibling repo is affected — none of the five uses any of
  the 17.

- **BREAKING: `RtfCfg` is now `RTFCfg`**, and the exported `Rtf*` fields on
  `Shape.TC` are now `RTF*` — `RTFRuns`, `RTFLayout`, `RTFFlatText`,
  `RTFBaseStyle`, `RTFLineSpacing`. `RTF(cfg RtfCfg)` was the only factory whose
  name disagreed with its `Cfg` in casing. The `Shape` fields are renamed
  alongside it because leaving them as `Rtf*` next to a new `RTFCfg` would trade
  one inconsistency for another inside the same widget. Unexported identifiers
  (`renderRtf`, `hasRtfLayout`) are unchanged.

  The casing split was not only cosmetic. `requiredid` derives a factory name by
  trimming `Cfg`, so `RtfCfg` implied a factory called `Rtf`, never matched the
  real `RTF`, and every `gui.RTF(gui.RtfCfg{…})` literal was skipped as
  possibly-wrapped. The rename re-enabled the check and surfaced four focusable
  RTF blocks in the showcase with no `ID` — keyboard-unreachable since they were
  written. All four now have one.

- **BREAKING: the five flat state-color fields are deleted from the six `Cfg`s
  that carried the full set** — `ButtonCfg`, `SwitchCfg`, `ToggleCfg`,
  `RadioCfg`, `InputDateCfg`, `DatePickerCfg`. `ColorHover`, `ColorFocus`,
  `ColorClick`, `ColorBorder` and `ColorBorderFocus` are replaced by
  `Colors ColorSet` on each. `Color` stays as the shorthand for `Colors.Base`.

  Migration is mechanical:

  ```go
  // before
  gui.ButtonCfg{Color: c, ColorHover: c, ColorClick: c,
      ColorFocus: c, ColorBorder: c, ColorBorderFocus: c}
  // after
  gui.ButtonCfg{Colors: gui.Flat(c)}

  // before
  gui.ButtonCfg{Color: bg, ColorBorder: b, ColorBorderFocus: a}
  // after
  gui.ButtonCfg{Colors: gui.ColorSet{Base: bg, Border: b, BorderFocus: a}}
  ```

  The 24 `Cfg`s holding a partial set (four fields down to one) keep the fields
  they had. "Carries the full five" is the line, because that is where
  `ColorSet` fits exactly.

  **`Color` does not pin the interactive states.** It sets the resting color and
  leaves hover, click and focus to the theme, exactly as before. `Flat(c)` is
  the deliberate opt-in for a widget that should not react.

### Fixed

- **Four focusable RTF blocks in `examples/showcase` had no `ID`**, so they
  rendered and clicked but never joined the tab order. Found by `requiredid`
  once the `RTFCfg` rename let it see them.

- **BREAKING: `DataGridCfg.OnCellFormat` and `OnDetailRowView` are now
  `CellFormat` and `DetailRowView`.** Neither is an event callback — both are
  view builders that return a value (`GridCellFormat` and `gg.View`), so the
  `On*` prefix misdescribed them. No reference to either name exists in any
  sibling repo, so the rename costs nothing outside this module.

### Added

- **Examples now teach `FillFill` instead of manual viewport math** (spec §4.8).
  `WindowSize()` in `examples/` drops from 45 files / 50 call sites to 8 files /
  9 call sites. The dominant pattern — fetch the window size, set it as the
  root's `Width`/`Height`, mark the root `FixedFixed` — is now just
  `Sizing: gui.FillFill`. `todo`'s hand-computed `cardView(ww-24, wh-24)` and
  `listbox`'s `Height: wh - 70` are gone; `minesweeper` no longer threads the
  viewport through both screens.

  The 8 remaining calls are allowlisted and each carries a one-line reason at
  the call site: canvas, particle, game and virtualized-list demos that compute
  positions in pixel space. `calculator` is one of them for a reason worth
  knowing — its root is a `Canvas`, which does not arrange its content, so a
  `FillFill` child of it measures 0×0.

  Three example tests moved from "did not panic" to real state assertions using
  the phase-2 testing API: `key_up_demo`, `todo` and `dialogs`.

- **An event-collapse check under `gui.Debug(true)`**, plus
  `(*Window).TestEventCollapse` to sweep a window with it armed. It reports
  consume-class callbacks that rely on automatic handling while an ancestor
  would also have received the event — the sites that would silently start
  firing twice if the consume/notify split were ever collapsed into one rule
  (spec §4.3b).

  This class of risk cannot be counted from source, because "would an ancestor
  have received it" is a property of the layout tree at dispatch time. The check
  therefore runs after each consume-class callback and replays that event's real
  dispatch condition — hit test plus `ClickButton` filter for `OnClick`, the
  centroid for `OnGesture`, focus for `OnChar` — against each ancestor.

  Sweeping 37 examples finds **18** such sites, against the 138 consume-class
  sites a source count had suggested, and nearly every one is a go-gui widget
  nested in another go-gui widget rather than application code. go-charts and
  go-map sweep clean. Findings and method: spec §4.3.3.

  Diagnostics only; nothing about dispatch changes. Off by default, and the
  event benchmarks stay at zero allocations.

- **`ColorSet` and `Flat`** (`gui/color_set.go`), as the `Colors` field. Landed
  on `ButtonCfg` in phase 3 and widened to six widgets in phase 4 (see
  "Changed"). Groups `Base`, `Hover`, `Click`, `Focus`, `Border` and
  `BorderFocus` into one value; `Flat(c)` pins all six for a widget that should
  not react to the pointer. `Base` backs the three interactive states,
  `BorderFocus` falls back to `Border`, and anything still unset falls through
  to the theme. An assigned flat `Color*` field takes precedence over the set,
  so existing code keeps its appearance. `examples/todo`'s accent button drops
  from six color lines to one. See [Styling widgets](README.md#styling-widgets).

  Fields are plain `Color`, reversing the spec's Q5: `Color` already carries its
  own set flag, so `Opt[Color]` would have added a second, competing notion of
  unset.

- **App-testing API in package `gui`.** `NewTestWindow` builds a backendless
  window; `TestRender`, `TestClick`, `TestFocus`, `TestKey`, `TestType`,
  `TestTab`, `TestScroll` and `TestScrollOffset` drive it by widget `ID`. Each
  synthesizes a real `Event` and pushes it through `Window.EventFn`, then
  settles a frame — so a test observes hit-testing, focus traversal and scroll
  clamping, not just the callback. Failures are returned as errors
  (`ErrTestNoSuchID`, `ErrTestDisabled`, `ErrTestNotFocusable`,
  `ErrTestNoHandler`, `ErrTestNotVisible`, `ErrTestUnhandled`), because in a
  test they are assertion failures, not programmer errors. See
  [Testing your app](README.md#testing-your-app).

  It lives in `gui` rather than a `guitest` subpackage because driving a click
  requires `Shape.events`, and a sibling package could only reach it by
  exporting that field permanently.

- **Nested-scroll regression gate** (`gui/scroll_nested_test.go`). Pins the
  current contract: an inner scrollable pinned at its limit declines the scroll
  so it cascades to the enclosing container. This is the one place the planned
  one-event-class collapse changes behavior with no compile error, and it was
  untestable before `TestScroll`/`TestScrollOffset` existed.

## [v0.53.0] - 2026-08-07

Developer-ergonomics phase 1 (`docs/specs/developer-ergonomics.md`), shipped as
PRs #189–#193.

A missing widget `ID` used to be invisible: the widget rendered, it clicked, and
it silently never joined the tab order. This release makes that a panic at
construction, a build-time diagnostic, and a runtime gate — and fixes the twelve
places the library itself got it wrong.

**Upgrading:** the nine input factories listed under _Changed_ now panic on an
empty `Cfg.ID`. Give each control a window-unique `ID`, or set
`FocusDisabled: true` on a control that is genuinely decorative. Measured
against the five sibling repos, this forces three edits in total (go-charts 1,
go-map 2), all in example code.

### Fixed

- **Twelve first-party widgets shipped buttons no keyboard user could reach**
  (developer-ergonomics §4.2, phase 1). Focus traversal is keyed by `ID`, so a
  focusable widget without one renders, clicks, and silently never joins the tab
  order. Each of these carried an `OnClick` and had no `ID`: the toast action
  and dismiss buttons, the date picker's month toggle and prev/next arrows, the
  date input's calendar button, the markdown code-block copy button, the
  overflow panel's trigger, the time-travel freeze button, and the DataGrid's
  header, CRUD, pager, filter-clear, column-chooser, and source-paging controls.

  IDs are **namespaced by the owning widget's own ID** rather than fixed
  strings, because these widgets can appear more than once in a window — two
  toasts, two date pickers, two grids. A constant `ID` would have replaced an
  unreachable button with a duplicate one, collapsing both onto a single tab
  stop and a single state slot. New `toastBtnID` helper;
  `dataGridIndicatorButton`, `dataGridOrderButton`, and `ttButton` take an `id`
  parameter.

  Those three take `id` as a parameter rather than deriving it from their
  `label` because the labels are not stable identity: DataGrid's come from
  `gg.ActiveLocale`, and the freeze button's alternates between "Pause" and
  "Resume". An ID tracking the label would move the widget's focus and state on
  a locale switch or a state change.

  One case went the other way: the date picker's out-of-month calendar cell is
  blank, disabled, and handler-less, so it now sets `FocusDisabled: true` rather
  than being given an ID for empty space. That is the decorative case the
  opt-out exists for.

### Added

- **Two preventive identity checks** (developer-ergonomics §4.9 and §4.1, phase
  1). Both found **zero** live defects in this repo, which is the point of
  landing them: the twelve a11y defects above all reached release because
  nothing looked.

  `tools/requiredid` gained `checkScrollableID`, reporting a literal that sets
  `Scrollable: true` with no `ID`. Scroll offsets are keyed by `ID`, so every
  ID-less scrollable in a window shares the key `""` and they scroll in lockstep
  — visible only once a second one exists, which is how it survives review. It
  mirrors `checkFocusableID` and keys on the field in the literal rather than a
  tag: a scrollable container is the exception, and a `gui:"required"` tag on
  `ContainerCfg.ID` would invert the default and flag the common case. The
  runtime half, `RequireScrollID`, was already wired.

  The `gui.Debug` gate gained an `OnMouseLeave`-without-`ID` check. This is a
  fourth ID-keyed behaviour the spec did not enumerate: `layoutMouseLeave`
  tracks the cursor through a map keyed by `ID` and, unlike the focus path, has
  **no `Focusable` precondition**. A `FocusDisabled` control carrying an
  `OnMouseLeave` is therefore still silently broken — the decorative opt-out
  covers focus, not identity — and neither the focus check nor `requireFocusID`
  catches it.

- **`ergoaudit -fix` codemod** (developer-ergonomics §8, phase 1). Tools-only;
  no shipped library code changes. Mode `focus` can now rewrite the literals it
  reports, inserting a generated `ID` into each. Phase 1 tags nine `Cfg` types
  with `gui:"required"`, which turns 111 literals in this repo into build
  failures at once — and hand-editing 111 literals is how a typo'd ID reaches
  `main` looking like intent. `-fix-dry-run` reports the proposed IDs without
  writing; `-fix-only` and `-fix-exclude` are regexps over repo-relative paths.
  `make ergo-fix-dry` and `make ergo-fix` wrap the phase-1 invocation, scoped to
  `_test.go` and `examples/` — go-gui's own widget defects get hand-chosen IDs,
  because a shipped widget's `ID` is public identity, not scaffolding.

  IDs come from a nested `TextCfg` label where there is one (`ButtonCfg`, the
  dominant broken type, has no `Text` field — its label lives in `Content`),
  otherwise the enclosing function, otherwise the `Cfg` type; each is made
  unique within its file and checked against IDs already written by hand. The
  rewrite is a byte splice applied in reverse offset order and then `gofmt`ed,
  rather than a reprint of the whole AST, so the diff is the insertions and
  nothing else. Single-line literals stay on one line.

  This does not reopen §5.1. That section rejects IDs _computed at runtime from
  tree position_, which have no source-level existence and silently reassign
  scroll offsets and dropdown state when a sibling is inserted. An ID generated
  into the source is an ordinary ID a human reads, reviews, and edits.

- **`gui:"required,focus"` tag option** (developer-ergonomics §4.2, phase 1).
  `tools/requiredid` now reads options off the `gui` tag: the `focus` option
  scopes the requirement to controls that join focus traversal, so a literal
  setting `FocusDisabled: true` satisfies it. A plain `gui:"required"` field is
  unaffected and stays required regardless — its state is keyed by `ID` whether
  or not the control takes focus.

  `ergoaudit` parses the tag rather than matching the bare `gui:"required"`
  string, which read any tag carrying options as absent. It also no longer
  counts a literal handed to a _different_ factory as broken:
  `CommandButton(cmdID, ButtonCfg{})` fills the `ID` in itself, so the empty
  `ID` at that call site proves nothing. That was one false positive in the 111,
  and neither `requiredid` (which matches on the factory name) nor the runtime
  guard (which runs after the wrapper has filled the field) ever agreed with it.

- **`gui.Debug(bool)` dev-mode diagnostics gate** (developer-ergonomics §4.1,
  phase 1). Generalizes the focus-only `GOGUI_FOCUS_DEBUG` check into one gate
  that audits each composed frame for identity defects the library otherwise
  reports in no way at all: two shapes sharing an `ID`, a focusable shape with
  no `ID` (renders and clicks, never joins the tab order), and a scrollable
  shape with no `ID` (shares one scroll offset with every other ID-less
  scrollable in the window). Findings go to stderr **once per finding per
  window** — these run per frame, so an undeduplicated warning would emit at the
  frame rate and be a reason to turn the gate back off. Cycling the gate off and
  on clears that memory, so a re-enabled gate reports current state. Set at
  startup by `GOGUI_DEBUG=1`; `GOGUI_FOCUS_DEBUG=1` still works. The flag is an
  `atomic.Bool` because `Debug` makes it mutable at runtime and the checks read
  it from the frame goroutine. Measured cost when off: no change in
  `BenchmarkViewFrame` allocs (202 / 802 allocs/op unchanged) or ns/op.

### Changed

- **Nine focusable-by-default widgets now require an `ID`**
  (developer-ergonomics §4.2, phase 1). `Button`, `Input`, `InputDate`,
  `NumericInput`, `RadioButtonGroup`, `Radio`, `Select`, `Switch`, and `Toggle`
  panic when handed an empty `Cfg.ID`. **This is a breaking change**: a config
  that used to render a control which quietly never took focus now fails on the
  first frame instead. That is the point — the old behaviour had no signal at
  all, so the defect survived to release twelve times in this repo alone.

  The requirement is scoped, not absolute. A control marked
  `FocusDisabled: true` never joins the tab order, so it has no identity to name
  and is exempt — the decorative case, such as the date picker's blank
  out-of-month cell. Both halves are expressed by a new tag option,
  `gui:"required,focus"`, which `tools/requiredid` reads statically and the
  unexported `requireFocusID` enforces at runtime.

  111 literals across this repo's tests and examples were updated by
  `make ergo-fix` rather than by hand.

- **`State[T]` names both types when it panics.** A window holding the wrong
  state type still panics — that is a programmer error discoverable on the first
  frame, not a runtime condition worth threading through every view function —
  but the message now reports the type held alongside the type requested instead
  of Go's bare interface-conversion text.

### Removed

- **`RequireFocusID`** (developer-ergonomics §4.2). Dead exported guard: zero
  call sites in go-gui, tests included, and zero across all five sibling repos,
  despite fourteen files exposing a `Focusable bool` field. Retaining it implied
  a check that never ran, which reads like coverage. Its static case belongs to
  the `requiredid` analyzer, which reports at build time with the `Cfg` type
  named; its dynamic case belongs to `RequireID` and the new debug gate. No
  consumer action required.

## [v0.52.1] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **`tools/eventctx` converts callbacks declared as methods.** The rewriter
  skipped every `func` with a receiver, so a repo that wires its callbacks as
  method values (`fv.internalClick`) got a converted call site and an
  unconverted declaration — go-charts hit 109 unresolvable build errors. The
  scanner now classifies methods alongside plain functions, the value-use scan
  ignores the method name in a call's selector, and the call folder accepts a
  selector callee. Tools-only: no shipped library code changed, so v0.52.0 and
  v0.52.1 are identical for anyone who is not running the migration.

## [v0.52.0] - 2026-08-07

### Changed

- **BREAKING: event callbacks take a single `EventCtx`.** Every callback that
  took `(*Layout, *Event, *Window)` now takes `func(EventCtx)`, where `EventCtx`
  bundles `Layout`, `Event` and `Window`. Payload carriers keep their payload as
  a leading argument: `func(*Layout, string, *Window)` becomes
  `func(string, EventCtx)` and `func(T, *Event, *Window)` becomes
  `func(T, EventCtx)`. `func(*Layout, *Window)` callbacks (`OnScroll`,
  `AmendLayout`, `InputCfg.OnBlur`) become `func(EventCtx)` with a nil
  `ctx.Event`. `func(*Window)` lifecycle callbacks, `OnDraw` and
  `Window.OnEvent` are unchanged. `EventCtx` is passed by value — three pointers
  in registers — so the zero-allocation layout, render and event phases stay at
  zero allocations.
- **BREAKING: consuming events are handled by default.** `OnClick`, `OnChar`,
  `OnMouseUp`, `OnGesture` and `OnFileDrop` are marked handled by dispatch
  before the callback runs; drop the trailing `e.IsHandled = true` and call
  `ctx.Bubble()` on paths that mean "not mine". Every other callback is
  unchanged and still calls `ctx.Consume()` to stop propagation — notably
  `OnKeyDown` (which must leave Tab and accelerators alone), the
  hover/move/leave notifications, and `OnMouseScroll` (whose cascade to the
  enclosing scroll container depends on the event staying unhandled). One
  visible consequence: `Window.OnEvent` no longer sees clicks, characters,
  mouse-ups, file drops or gestures that a widget handled.
- **`EventCtx` methods.** `Consume()` marks handled, `Bubble()` unmarks it,
  `Handled()` reports the flag. All three are nil-`Event` safe, so they are
  callable from `AmendLayout` and `OnScroll` without a guard. `Bubble()` opts
  out of the current callback's auto-consume only; it does not un-handle an
  event an earlier handler consumed.
- **Migration guide:** `docs/migration-eventctx.md`. The rewrite tool that
  produced this change ships as `tools/eventctx`.

### Removed

- **`spacebarToClick`, `enterToClick` and `leftClickOnly`.** The three
  deprecated wrapper helpers had no production call sites; the `ClickOnSpace`,
  `ClickOnEnter` and `ClickButton` dispatch fields superseded them and avoid the
  per-frame closure allocation.

## [v0.51.1] - 2026-08-07

### Changed

- **go-glyph v1.18.2 → v1.19.0.** Brings cap-height-matched fallback glyphs
  (fallback letters as tall as the primary's), upright-face preference on weight
  ties, and scratch `CachedGlyph` slice reuse (no per-frame allocation in the
  terminal steady-state path).

## [v0.51.0] - 2026-08-06

### Changed

- **`Event.ScrollX`/`ScrollY` now have a defined unit.** For a discrete mouse
  wheel (`ScrollPrecise` false) they carry **lines of text**, and every backend
  converts its native representation to the platform's lines-per- notch —
  roughly three on all of them. Precise/trackpad deltas are unchanged and still
  carry pre-scaled points of finger travel; consumers that care must branch on
  `ScrollPrecise`. The field previously had no documented unit and each backend
  picked its own: Metal pre-scaled a notch to 2.5 while Win32 and X11 emitted a
  bare 1.0, so the same gesture scrolled 2.5x further on macOS than on Windows
  or Linux. Embedders that scaled `ScrollY` by their own constant (rather than
  by `Theme.ScrollMultiplier`) should re-check their factor.

### Fixed

- **Mouse wheel ignored the Windows scroll-speed setting.** The Win32 backend
  reported a bare notch count and never read `SPI_GETWHEELSCROLLLINES` (Control
  Panel → Mouse → Wheel, three lines by default), so an embedder scaling by its
  own per-unit constant scrolled a fraction of what the user asked for. The
  setting is now honoured, including the "one screen at a time"
  (`WHEEL_PAGESCROLL`) sentinel, and re-read per event so a change applies
  without a restart. `WM_MOUSEHWHEEL` gained the matching
  `SPI_GETWHEELSCROLLCHARS` handling.
- **X11 wheel buttons carried no magnitude.** Buttons 4–7 now report three lines
  per notch, matching GTK, Qt, and the Windows default.

## [v0.50.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- **Window icons on Linux and Windows.** The GL backend now publishes
  `WindowCfg.IconPNG` (or the go-gui default) as `_NET_WM_ICON` on X11 and as
  the big/small window icons via `WM_SETICON` on Windows, so the taskbar and
  alt-tab show the app's icon instead of the window manager's default. New
  `WindowCfg.WMClass` sets the X11 `WM_CLASS` property (both slots) for window
  grouping and `.desktop`-file matching. The Windows tray icon path moves into
  `gui/backend/internal/hicon`, shared with the GL backend.

## [v0.49.1] - 2026-08-05

### Changed

- **Dependency: `go-glyph` v1.18.1 → v1.18.2.** Picks up the atlas fix where
  glyph uploads now precede textured draws, eliminating the one-frame blank lag
  on first glyph appearance.

## [v0.49.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- **X11 IME support via IBus over D-Bus (#150).** Linux windows can now compose
  text with an input method: IBus connects over D-Bus, receives pre-edit
  clauses, and delivers committed text to the focused widget. Pre-edit display
  is hooked into the standard composition path, the selected clause is
  highlighted from `IBusAttrList` (#163), and the connection closes race-free
  with a bounded queue that matches the release keysym column (#167).

### Changed

- **Linux audio is now cgo-free by default (#141).** `gui/audio` decoded and
  mixed with pure-Go `beep`, but its output sink went through `oto`, whose Linux
  driver is cgo (ALSA). That left one package blocking
  `CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build ./...` even after the go-gl removal in
  #137. The output driver is now a small three-function seam
  (`outputInit`/`outputPlay`/`outputClose`) with two implementations: the
  default Linux build uses a pure-Go PulseAudio sink
  (`github.com/jfreymuth/pulse`, native protocol over a socket), so the whole
  module cross-compiles with no C toolchain. It requires a running PulseAudio or
  PipeWire server — present on any desktop; when absent, `audio.Init` returns an
  error and audio is disabled rather than crashing. Building with
  `-tags otoaudio` selects the previous oto/ALSA backend for direct-ALSA or
  maximum hardware compatibility. The public `gui/audio` API is unchanged, and
  Windows/macOS still use oto. The CGo-free CI cross-compile widened from
  `./gui/backend/...` to `./...`.
- **Dependencies: go-glyph bumped to v1.18.1.**
- **Test: GL backend smoke test skips when cgo is linked (#168).** The smoke
  test needs the cgo-free dispatch path; when the binary is built with cgo the
  load fails, so the test now skips instead of failing.
- **Docs: C toolchain requirement scoped to macOS only.**

## [v0.48.1] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- **Key repeat delivered no characters on macOS (#159).** macOS press-and-hold
  is on by default. After the first `insertText:`, AppKit hands the held key to
  the accent-palette machinery and stops calling `insertText:` for the
  auto-repeat `keyDown:` events that follow, so every repeat reached the toolkit
  as a bare `EventKeyDown` with no `EventChar` behind it. Holding a letter typed
  one character, holding Backspace deleted one character, and a terminal pane
  echoed nothing for the whole hold. `metalAppInit` now registers
  `ApplePressAndHoldEnabled=NO` before `sharedApplication`. Registered rather
  than written: the registration domain sits at the bottom of the defaults
  search order, so nothing is persisted to disk and
  `defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true` — which lives in
  NSGlobalDomain and outranks it — still restores the accent palette for anyone
  who wants it over key repeat.

## [v0.48.0] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- **Re-focusing an already-focused widget destroyed the IME composition
  (#156).** `SetFocus` was not idempotent: it cleared the preedit and
  re-activated the platform input context even when the requested ID was already
  the focused one. Consumers legitimately re-assert focus from inside their
  `View` function, which runs on every layout rebuild — i.e. after every
  keystroke — so a CJK composition was torn down between each update. The
  preedit flashed and never accumulated, leaving CJK input unusable end to end.
  `imeClear` and the `IMEStart`/`IMEStop` pair now run only on a real focus
  change. Text-selection clearing and the cursor-blink reset are unchanged, so
  callers that re-focus to reset a selection still work.
- **App fonts were ignored on iOS and Android (#132).** Both backends loaded the
  bundled icon font but never called `gui.LoadAppFonts`, so `RegisterAppFont` /
  `RegisterAppFontBytes` were a silent no-op there. That also made
  `ThemeCfg.IconFontFamily` unusable on those platforms — retargeting the themed
  icon styles at a font that never loaded rendered tofu. Both now register the
  app-font lists right after the icon font, as the GL and Metal backends already
  did.
- **Metal backend dropped IME commit events (#149).** Text-input callbacks wrote
  a single global event slot, so when one `[NSApp sendEvent:]` fired several
  `NSTextInputClient` callbacks — the normal CJK sequence of `insertText:`
  (commit) immediately followed by `setMarkedText:` (residual composition) —
  each overwrote the previous and only the last reached Go. Committing Japanese
  produced zero characters; preedit rendering was unaffected. Text events now go
  through a FIFO drained one per `metalPollEvent`, so every callback is
  delivered, in order. The `_evIMEGeneration`/`_evIMEConsumedGen` pair is gone —
  an empty queue encodes the same signal.
- **Japanese converted text could never be committed on macOS.** After the IME
  converted a composition (Space, or picking from the candidate window), Enter
  did nothing at all: no `insertText:`, no callback of any kind, and the preedit
  stayed on screen forever. Two `NSTextInputClient` methods were stubbed in ways
  the input method treats as "this client has no document": `selectedRange`
  returned `{NSNotFound, 0}` — which IMK then used as the base for its range
  arithmetic, producing garbage queries like `{NSNotFound - 30, 30}` — and
  `attributedSubstringForProposedRange:` returned `nil`, though a converted
  commit asks for the text it is replacing. `selectedRange` now reports the
  selection the IME last set inside the composition, and
  `attributedSubstringForProposedRange:` serves the composition text (clamped,
  `nil` only when genuinely out of range). `validAttributesForMarkedText` now
  advertises the standard marked-text attributes instead of an empty list.
  Reproduced and fixed against a plain AppKit program with no go-gui code in it,
  so this was protocol conformance, not an event-loop problem. Unconverted kana
  commits were unaffected, which is why plain `nihongo` + Enter always worked.
- **Keys the input method owns no longer also reach the widget on macOS.** While
  a composition is live the IME owns the keyboard — arrows move between
  conversion clauses, Enter commits, Escape reverts — but the raw `EventKeyDown`
  was delivered as well, so the field's caret (and the preedit drawn at it) slid
  sideways under the arrow keys, and Enter could fire a widget action
  mid-composition. `keyDown:` now marks a keystroke as claimed when a
  composition was in progress or the key started one, and `metalPollEvent` drops
  it; the visible effect arrives as the queued composition or commit instead.
- **Placeholder text no longer stays visible during IME composition.** The
  preedit was inserted into the placeholder rather than replacing it, so the
  hint was pushed out to the right of the composing text ("かんEnter a name"). A
  placeholder is a hint, not content, so a composition now replaces it outright;
  a field with real text still gets the preedit inserted at the cursor. Applies
  to every backend, not just macOS.
- **Metal backend now reports the end of an IME composition.** An empty
  `setMarkedText:` (composition cancelled) previously wrote no event at all,
  leaving the preedit on screen. It is delivered as an `EventIMEComposition`
  with empty `IMEText`, which `Window.imeUpdate` already treats as "clear".
- **IME composition offsets are clamped to the preedit.** `IMEStart` and
  `IMELength` cross a platform boundary — Cocoa's `NSRange`, the Android
  bridge's `int64`, the browser's composition events — and fed slice arithmetic
  in the render path unchecked. `NSNotFound` in particular truncates to `-1` in
  the event's `int32`. `Window.imeUpdate` now clamps both to the composition's
  rune range, so a confused or hostile input method can mis-place an underline
  but cannot panic the renderer.
- **Web backend: keys the input method owns no longer reach the widget.** The
  browser fires `keydown` for arrows, Enter and Escape during a composition
  (`key == "Process"`, `isComposing == true`); the handler mapped the physical
  `code` and delivered an `EventKeyDown` anyway, so the caret slid out from
  under the preedit and Enter could fire a widget action mid-composition. The
  same class of bug as the macOS fix above. Composing keydowns are now ignored.
- **Web backend: a cancelled composition now reports its end.** `compositionend`
  with empty data (Escape) returned without emitting anything, relying on a
  preceding `compositionupdate` to clear the state — a browser/IME-dependent
  assumption. It now emits an `EventIMEComposition` with empty `IMEText`
  directly.

### Changed

- **GL backend no longer needs cgo (#155).** The `github.com/go-gl/gl`
  dependency is replaced by `gui/backend/internal/glbind`, which loads the GL
  entry points through purego, so the Linux and Windows backends build with
  `CGO_ENABLED=0`. Loading is all-or-nothing — the full binding table resolves
  or init returns an error — so there is no partial, silently broken GL state.
  Proc loading is per-platform (`egl_linux.go`, `wgl_windows.go`). No API change
  for embedders; the macOS/Metal and web backends are untouched.
- **macOS now emits `EventKeyDown` for printable keys**, followed by
  `EventChar`, matching X11, win32 and web. The KeyDown was previously swallowed
  by the same single-slot overwrite. Text input is unaffected (insertion runs on
  the Char path only), but two consequences are worth noting for macOS apps: a
  `Command` registered with a modifier-less `Shortcut` (e.g.
  `Shortcut{Key: KeyA}`) now fires on plain typing, as it already did on
  Linux/Windows; and `InputCfg.OnKeyDown` now fires for printable keys.
  Space-activated `OnKeyDown` handlers (select, combobox, listbox, tree, date
  picker, menu) become live on macOS — previously dead.

### Documentation

- `Event.CharCode` documents that it carries only the first rune of an IME
  commit; the full string is in `IMEText`.

## [v0.47.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- **Exported setters for the four remaining mouse cursors.**
  `Window.SetMouseCursorIBeam`, `SetMouseCursorNotAllowed`,
  `SetMouseCursorResizeNESW` and `SetMouseCursorResizeNWSE` join the six that
  were already public. All ten `MouseCursor` values were implemented and loaded
  by every backend (metal `NSCursor`, x11 `XC_xterm`/`XC_X_cursor`, win32
  `IDC_IBEAM`, web `"text"`); these four had stayed unexported only because
  go-gui's own widgets were the sole callers. An embedder driving the cursor
  from an external protocol — a terminal widget honoring OSC 22, a canvas app
  with its own hit regions — could not reach them and had to fall back to Arrow.
  Additive; no behavior change.

## [v0.46.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- **X11 PRIMARY selection.** `Window.SetPrimary`/`GetPrimary` (with the matching
  `SetPrimaryFn`/`SetPrimaryGetFn` backend hooks) expose the select-to-copy
  buffer that middle-click pastes on Unix — independent of CLIPBOARD, so an app
  can hold two different values at once. The X11 backend already owned
  selections for CLIPBOARD; PRIMARY reuses that machinery via a shared
  `selectionState` mapping, and `SelectionClear` now releases only the selection
  actually lost instead of both. Other backends leave the hooks nil, so
  `GetPrimary` returns `""` and `SetPrimary` is a no-op on macOS, Windows, web,
  and mobile.

## [v0.45.1] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- **Metal backend: AppKit calls could land on a non-main thread.** The Go
  runtime starts the main goroutine on thread 0 but does not keep it there — any
  blocking syscall or cgo call before the backend starts (config load, font
  registration, reading a file named on the command line) can let the scheduler
  resume `main` on another M. `backend.New` / `backend.RunApp` then called
  `runtime.LockOSThread` on the _wrong_ thread and the first AppKit call aborted
  with `API misuse: setting the main menu on a non-main thread`. The metal
  package now calls `runtime.LockOSThread` from `init`, which runs while the
  main goroutine is still on thread 0. Importing the backend is sufficient;
  embedders need no init boilerplate.
- **Same main-thread pin applied to the `gl` (X11/Win32) and `ios` backends.**
  Latent rather than fatal there, but the same migration applies: an OpenGL
  context is current on one thread at a time, Win32 delivers a window's messages
  only to the thread that created it, and UIKit has AppKit's main-thread rule.
  All three now lock from `init` instead of relying on the late `LockOSThread`
  in `New` / `RunAppE` / `Run`.

## [v0.45.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- **`DrawContext.ImageClipped`.** Draws an image restricted to a sub-rectangle:
  the texture still maps to the full destination rect, a scissor decides what is
  visible. `DrawCanvasImageEntry` gained `ClipX`/`ClipY`/`ClipW`/`ClipH` plus a
  `Clipped` flag to carry it, and the emit path intersects that rect with the
  canvas clip (`RenderClip` replaces the scissor rather than nesting) and
  restores the canvas clip afterwards. Consumers that must paint a fragment of
  an image without cropping the source file — a terminal emulator showing the
  visible cells of an image whose remaining cells sit behind another pane —
  could not express that before. Recorders (SVG/PDF export) receive the
  unclipped image, unchanged.

## [v0.44.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- **`NativeMenubarCfg.OmitAboutItem`.** Drops "About <AppName>" and its
  separator from the app menu, leaving Quit alone, for apps that expose About
  under their own Help menu. Takes precedence over `AboutActionID` — no About
  item is created at all.
- **`NativeMenubarCfg.IncludeWindowMenu`.** Auto-wires the standard Window menu
  (Close, Minimize, Zoom, Bring All to Front) and registers it with the OS
  window list. Installing a menubar replaces the backend's default one, so
  without this an app silently loses Cmd+W / Cmd+M.
- **`ThemeCfg.IconFontFamily`.** Sets the font family used by every theme-driven
  icon style (`Theme.Icon1`…`Icon6` and `TreeStyle.TextStyleIcon`), so an app
  that ships its own curated icon font can retarget them all with one field.
  Mirrors the existing `MonoFontFamily` handling: defaulted to `IconFontName` in
  `baseCfg()`, and an empty value falls back to `IconFontName`. No behavior
  change for existing apps — the bundled Feather font stays embedded,
  registered, and the default.
- **`gui.RegisterAppFontBytes([]byte)`.** Registers an in-memory font (e.g. one
  loaded with `go:embed`) alongside the existing path-based `RegisterAppFont`.
  The text system persists the bytes to its own temp file and removes it on
  teardown, so callers no longer need to manage one. Consumed by the GL and
  Metal backends, matching where `AppFontPaths` is consumed today.
- **`gui.LoadAppFonts(FontRegistrar, string)`.** Registers everything in
  `AppFontPaths` and `AppFontData` with a text system, logging and skipping
  fonts that fail to load so one bad font cannot stop the window from coming up.
  Replaces the per-backend loops the GL and Metal backends each carried, and
  takes the narrow `gui.FontRegistrar` interface (`AddFontFile`/`AddFontBytes`)
  so backends yet to adopt it — iOS, Android — can wire it up with one call.

### Fixed

- **Programmatic `Window.Dialog` / `DialogDismiss` now force a layout rebuild.**
  The dialog overlay is built during a full layout pass, so a caller outside the
  event path — a native menu action, a `QueueCommand` from a worker — left the
  window otherwise idle and the render-only frames a blinking cursor produces
  reused the existing layout tree. The dialog stayed invisible (or, on dismiss,
  stayed on screen) until an unrelated event forced a rebuild.

## [v0.43.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- **`Window.PumpFrame`.** Drives a single frame — flush, rebuild, present — from
  outside the normal event loop. This is what lets the Metal backend keep
  rendering while a nested AppKit run loop (a modal sheet, a native menu
  tracking session) owns the main thread.

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `CommandButton` no longer takes a `*Window`.** The signature is
  now `CommandButton(cmdID string, cfg ButtonCfg) View`. Command lookup,
  auto-label, auto-disable, and `OnClick` wiring are deferred to
  `GenerateLayout` via `ViewFunc`, so the widget no longer needs a window at
  construction time. Callers drop the first argument:
  `gui.CommandButton(w, "save", cfg)` → `gui.CommandButton("save", cfg)`.
- **Dependencies: `go-glyph` bumped to v1.18.0**, picking up `TextSystem.Purge`
  / `GlyphAtlas.Reset` / `Renderer.PurgeGlyphCache` for mid-session glyph and
  atlas memory reclamation.

### Fixed

- **Metal: frames no longer freeze under a nested AppKit run loop.** A modal
  sheet or native menu tracking session blocked the event loop; frames are now
  pumped for the duration.
- **Metal: removed an MSL lambda that broke every app on macOS Sonoma.** The
  shader failed to compile on Sonoma, taking down app startup.

## [v0.42.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **System alert sound.** `Window.Beep` plays the platform's alert sound
  (`NSBeep` on macOS, `MessageBeep` on Windows, the freedesktop `bell` event via
  `canberra-gtk-play` on Linux), honoring the user's system-wide alert sound
  choice, volume, and mute settings. `Window.BeepAvailable` reports whether the
  platform can actually produce one, so callers can fall back to a visual cue on
  mobile, wasm, and Linux without canberra installed. Backed by the new
  `gui/backend/sysbeep` package and a `NativeSound` sub-interface on
  `NativePlatform`. This is for incidental out-of-band alerts such as a terminal
  BEL — it loads no assets and holds no output device open, unlike `gui/audio`.
- **ViewFunc.** A function adapter for `gui.View` that defers construction of
  window-dependent subtrees to layout time, keeping the content tree free of a
  pre-created `*Window` reference.

## [v0.41.1] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- **Command-queue buffer race.** `flushCommands` recycled its buffer into the
  scratch pool before finishing iteration; a concurrent `QueueCommand` from the
  animation goroutine could reclaim that same array and append into it
  mid-iteration, losing or duplicating queued commands. The buffer is now handed
  back only after execution completes.
- **Smooth scrolling could end fractionally short of its target.** A settled
  ease retires one animation tick after computing its final value; a main thread
  that missed that 16ms window dropped the snap-to-target. Entries now carry a
  dirty flag so the final value survives until the next flush, and a cancel
  clears it so direct offset writes are never overwritten by a stale eased
  value.

## [v0.41.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **One-shot scroll anchoring.** New `Window.ScrollAnchor(scrollID, anchorID)`
  corrects the scroll offset on the next layout pass so the anchor view keeps
  the viewport-relative position it has now — content inserted or removed above
  the reader no longer causes a visual jump. The correction runs inside the
  layout pipeline (new `layoutApplyScrollAnchors` pass after `layoutPositions`),
  before the frame renders, so no intermediate position is ever shown. Requests
  are one-shot, last-write-wins per scrollable, vertical only, and bail to a
  plain jump when the anchor left the view, the content fits the viewport, or
  the correction would leave the scrollable range.
- **`Window.ScrollAnchorReveal`** anchors, then eases the scrollable to the top
  with the same smoothing as `ScrollVerticalToSmooth`, so prepended content
  glides into view. The ease arms inside the pipeline after the correction lands
  (arming beforehand would no-op when the reader is already at the top). An
  in-flight ease stays continuous across an anchoring correction: its displayed
  position shifts with the content, its absolute target is preserved.
- **`Window.ScrollVerticalOffset(id)`** returns the current vertical scroll
  offset (<= 0, 0 = top), complementing the existing percentage-based
  `ScrollVerticalPct`.

## [v0.40.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Smooth programmatic scrolling.** New `Window.ScrollVerticalToSmooth` and
  `Window.ScrollHorizontalToSmooth` ease a scrollable to an absolute offset
  using the same exponential smoothing as discrete mouse-wheel scrolling. No-op
  when the scroll id is not found or the target equals the current offset;
  instant `ScrollVerticalTo`/`ScrollHorizontalTo` still cancel any in-flight
  ease. The wheel smoother's arm logic is now shared
  (`scrollSmoothParams`/`scrollSmoothArm`) between relative wheel deltas and
  absolute targets.

### Changed

- **Deps:** go-glyph upgraded to v1.17.3 (perf/mem optimizations across the
  shaping pipeline, lazy font parsing, raster scratch-buffer pooling, sampled
  glyph-cache eviction).

### Fixed

- **Switch focus highlight.** Spacer no longer participates in focus ring
  drawing.
- **Toggle check-box sizing.** Off-by-one in hit-target calculation fixed.
- **Metal mouse-down consumed by window resize drag.** Drag resize no longer
  leaks mouse-down to the app's mouse handler.
- **Input batched-event echo and vertical centering.** Batched updates no longer
  echo raw text; single-line fields center vertically after font-size changes.
- **Data-grid quick-filter debounce.** Draft rendering during quick-filter is
  properly debounced.
- **Sidebar close layout:** Sidebar drops children when fully closed to prevent
  a fixed-width-0 content-resize bug.
- **BoundedMap small-map fast path.** Pre-sizing the BoundedMap data map is
  removed to keep the fast path for small maps.
- **buttonView folded into containerView,** and shapeEffects are pooled,
  reducing per-button allocations.

## [v0.39.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **`BoundedMap.GetOr`.** New method on `BoundedMap` that accepts a constructor
  function, returning an existing value or publishing a new one without a double
  lookup. Internal `BoundedMap.Get` callers with ignored-ok returns have been
  migrated to `GetOr`, hardening the map against lost writes.
- **Process monitor example.** New `examples/process_monitor` — a live task
  manager: filterable process list with flat/tree views, sortable columns, and
  per-process CPU/RAM history charts built from plain containers. Data is
  collected dependency-free (`ps` on macOS/Linux, `tasklist` on Windows;
  `/proc/meminfo` or `sysctl`+`vm_stat` for system memory), sampled on a
  background goroutine that publishes under the window lock and refreshes via
  `Window.UpdateWindow`. Styled entirely from the standard theme tokens.
  Includes a headless `-once` terminal report. Functional port of the go-shirei
  example of the same name.

### Changed

- **Dependency bump.** Updated go-glyph to v1.17.2 (background cache warming for
  CJK fallback coverage; no API change).

## [v0.38.1] - 2026-07-17

### Changed

- **Dependency bump.** Updated go-glyph to v1.17.1 (struct field alignment,
  lower per-instance memory; no API change).
- **`examples/fontviewer` cleanup.** Named magic numbers and removed code smells
  in the font viewer example.

## [v0.38.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Font viewer example + font-enumeration API.** New `examples/fontviewer`
  browses installed system fonts in a virtualized card grid — name filter,
  editable sample text, 12–72 px size slider, click-to-copy. Backed by new
  public API: `gui.ListSystemFonts` with the optional `FontLister` backend
  capability, and
  `gui.ListVisibleRange(itemCount, rowHeight, listHeight, scrollY, overscan)`
  for grid/list virtualization. Requires go-glyph v1.17.0.

### Changed

- **`Sizing: FillFill` root now fills the window.** A root layout has no parent
  to fill against, so a `FillFill` root previously collapsed to content size;
  filling the window required boilerplate `WindowSize()` plus an explicit
  `Width`/`Height` and `FixedFixed`. Each Fill axis of the root is now pinned to
  the window dimension, so the intuitive spelling works and the examples/docs
  drop the boilerplate.

### Fixed

- **Fixed-size containers with a 0 dimension no longer break clipping and
  hit-testing.** A container with `SizingFixed` and an explicit 0 width/height
  rendered (its children self-draw) but kept zero-area bounds, collapsing the
  `shapeClip` — and therefore the clip region and the pointer/hit-test region —
  of every descendant, so a child with `Clip: true` vanished and interactive
  children went inert. Such a box now degrades to content sizing on the zero
  axis. (#94)

## [v0.37.0] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- **BREAKING: remaining interactive controls are focusable by default.**
  `ButtonCfg`, `RadioCfg`, `RadioButtonGroupCfg`, `ComboboxCfg`, `ListBoxCfg`,
  `TreeCfg`, `DatePickerCfg`, `ColorPickerCfg`, `NumericInputCfg`, and
  `InputDateCfg` drop `Focusable bool` and gain `FocusDisabled bool`: the zero
  value is now _focusable_, and `FocusDisabled: true` is the explicit opt-out.
  This completes the focusable-by-default flip started in v0.36.0 (which covered
  Input, Select, Slider, Toggle, and Switch).

  Focus still requires a non-empty `ID` — an ID-less control is inert.
  `Disabled` still excludes from the tab order.

  Migration (compile error on the removed field is the guide):
  - `Focusable: true` → delete the line (now the default).
  - `Focusable: <expr>` → `FocusDisabled: !<expr>`.
  - `Focusable: false` → `FocusDisabled: true`.

- **`InputDateCfg` outer Column gains focusability.** Previously the outer
  container never set `Focusable`, so even with `Focusable: true` the date field
  was unreachable by keyboard. The outer Column now maps to
  `Focusable: !cfg.FocusDisabled`, matching the inner Input's focus state.

- **`DatePickerCfg` and `ColorPickerCfg` drop redundant `cfg.Focusable` gates**
  on focus-visual handlers. Focus visuals (border, color) now always apply when
  focused; `Disabled` remains the guard.

- **`NumericInputCfg` and `InputDateCfg` propagate `FocusDisabled` directly** to
  their inner `Input` instead of translating the inverse (`!cfg.Focusable`). The
  opt-out intent passes through transparently.

### Fixed

- `InputDateCfg` callers: the outer Column was never focusable even with
  `Focusable: true`. The inner `Input` was reachable but the container wasn't —
  focus now flows consistently through the composite widget.

## [v0.36.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **`InputCfg.ReadOnly`** — blocks text edits while the field stays focusable
  and selectable. Navigation, selection, and copy keep working; typing, IME
  text, paste, cut, undo/redo, delete, multiline Enter, and
  `PostCommitNormalize` are all skipped. Single-line Enter still fires
  `OnEnter`/`OnTextCommit`, with the text uncommitted and unnormalized. The
  field is announced to assistive tech as `AccessStateReadOnly`. Mirrors HTML's
  `readonly`, and is distinct from `Disabled`, which removes the field from
  interaction entirely.

  This state was previously inexpressible: `AccessStateReadOnly` could only be
  produced by setting `Focusable: false`, which also dropped the field from the
  tab order — so an Input was either editable or unreachable, with nothing in
  between. (With the focusable-by-default flip below, `ReadOnly` is now the only
  trigger for the read-only announcement.)

- **`NumericInputCfg.ReadOnly` and `InputDateCfg.ReadOnly`** — extend
  `InputCfg.ReadOnly` to the two composite wrappers. Both forward the flag to
  their inner `Input` (blocking typing) and gate the secondary mutation paths
  that bypass the text field: `NumericInput` disables and gates its step buttons
  at the `numericInputApplyStep` choke point, and `InputDate` keeps the calendar
  popup closed so its picker can never emit a selection. Enter-commit on the
  read-only inner `Input` no longer surfaces a value/date change. Both wrappers
  announce `AccessStateReadOnly`. `NumericInputCfg` and `InputDateCfg` already
  had `Disabled`; `ReadOnly` is the focusable-but-uneditable counterpart.

### Fixed

- **Read-only Input no longer renders IME preedit.** A composition started on a
  read-only field displayed preedit text that could never commit
  (`makeInputOnChar` swallows the commit), leaving a stray artifact until focus
  change. Preedit rendering is now suppressed for read-only fields; selection
  and cursor still render, since the field stays `Focusable`. Editable fields
  are unaffected.

- **`CommandButton` now auto-fills `ID`** from the command ID, prefixed with
  `cmdbtn:`. Focus traversal is keyed by `Shape.ID`, so a `CommandButton` with
  `Focusable: true` but no explicit `ID` was silently unreachable by keyboard.
  The prefix keeps the button's focus ID distinct from the menu item driven by
  the same command, which carries the raw command ID. Widgets that were dead tab
  stops now join the tab order; pass an explicit `cfg.ID` for two buttons on one
  command in the same window.
- **36 examples** set `Focusable: true` without an `ID` and were not
  keyboard-reachable, including `get_started`. All now carry stable IDs. `snake`
  also dropped `controlsIDBase`/`startButtonID` numeric focus IDs left over from
  the removed `IDFocus uint32` API.

### Changed

- **BREAKING: input controls are focusable by default.** `InputCfg`,
  `SelectCfg`, `SliderCfg`, `ToggleCfg`, and `SwitchCfg` drop `Focusable bool`
  and gain `FocusDisabled bool`: the zero value is now _focusable_, and
  `FocusDisabled: true` is the explicit opt-out. An input the user can't tab to
  is a bug, not a design choice — and for `Select`/`Slider`/`Toggle`/`Switch`
  this is an accessibility fix, not just deboilerplating: ID-bearing call sites
  that never set `Focusable` now join the Tab order (a slider should be
  keyboard-adjustable).

  Focus still requires a non-empty `ID` (`Focusable && ID != ""`). An ID-less
  control is **inert**: it renders but never becomes a tab stop, and no ID is
  ever fabricated. `Disabled` still excludes a control from the tab order;
  `ReadOnly` still keeps it focusable.

  Migration (compile error on the removed field is the guide):
  - `Focusable: true` → delete the line (now the default).
  - `Focusable: <expr>` → `FocusDisabled: !<expr>`.
  - `Focusable: false` → `FocusDisabled: true`.

  Out-of-scope widgets keep opt-in `Focusable bool`: Button, Container, Text,
  and the composites/wrappers (`Combobox`, `DatePicker`, `ListBox`,
  `RadioButtonGroup`, `NumericInput`, `InputDate`, `Radio`, ColorPicker,
  ThemePicker, Tree) — the wrappers translate their `Focusable` into the inner
  Input's `FocusDisabled`.

  The four focus flags, disambiguated:

  | Flag                  | Meaning                                                  |
  | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `Shape.Focusable`     | widget participates in the focus system                  |
  | `FocusSkip`           | focusable + click/selection, but excluded from Tab order |
  | `FocusDisabled` (Cfg) | opt out of the default-on focus (in-scope Cfgs)          |
  | `Disabled`            | non-interactive; also excluded from Tab order            |

- **A non-focusable Input no longer announces `AccessStateReadOnly`.** Before
  the flip, `Focusable: false` was the only way to express an uneditable field,
  so it doubled as the read-only signal. Now that non-focusable means an
  explicit `FocusDisabled` opt-out, only `ReadOnly: true` announces read-only.

- **`requiredid` analyzer** now also flags Cfg literals that set
  `Focusable: true` without a non-empty `ID`, catching this class of silent
  no-op at `go vet` time.

## [v0.35.1] - 2026-07-15

Documentation-only release. No code or behavior changes; no migration needed.

### Changed

- **`GenerateViewLayout` is no longer deprecated**. It is the supported entry
  point for composite View widgets, which need to recurse a View tree into a
  Layout tree. The deprecation pointed at `View.GenerateLayout`, which builds a
  single node and does not recurse into `Content()` — it was never an equivalent
  replacement, and no other exported path existed. Callers that hand-rolled
  their own recursion to avoid the warning should call `GenerateViewLayout`
  again; it applies shape normalization, the child-count clamp, and frame-arena
  pre-sizing that a hand-rolled copy misses. (#52)

### Fixed

- **README**: removed SDL2-era install steps, corrected the text stack
  description to the current pure-Go path, and refreshed the code samples to the
  current API.

## [v0.35.0] - 2026-07-15

### Changed

- **BREAKING — Scroll API**: `Shape.IDScroll uint32` is replaced by
  `Scrollable bool` plus string scroll identity (the widget's `ID`). A container
  opts into the scroll system with `Scrollable: true` and a non-empty `ID`;
  scroll offset is keyed by that `ID`. Migration: `IDScroll: N` →
  `Scrollable: true` (with a non-empty `ID`). Scrollable containers now panic at
  build if `ID` is empty (`RequireScrollID`).
- **BREAKING — Lost scroll handle**: the caller-supplied `IDScroll uint32` is
  removed from `ContainerCfg`, `ListBoxCfg`, `TreeCfg`, `TableCfg`,
  `ComboboxCfg`, `CommandPaletteCfg`, `InputCfg` and `DataGridCfg`. The scroll
  key is now _derived_ from the widget's `ID`; pass that same derived string to
  `Window.ScrollVerticalTo`/`ScrollHorizontalTo`/`…Pct` etc. Derived keys:

  | Cfg                                                 | scroll key                                            |
  | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
  | `ContainerCfg`, `ListBoxCfg`, `TreeCfg`, `InputCfg` | `cfg.ID`                                              |
  | `TableCfg`                                          | `cfg.ID`, or `cfg.ID + ":scroll"` when `FreezeHeader` |
  | `ComboboxCfg`                                       | `cfg.ID + ".dropdown"`                                |
  | `CommandPaletteCfg`                                 | `cfg.ID + ":scroll"`                                  |
  | `DataGridCfg`                                       | `cfg.ID + ":scroll"`                                  |

  `DataGridCfg.IDScroll` (an identity override) is deleted, not migrated; the
  key always derives from `cfg.ID + ":scroll"`.

- **BREAKING — Window scroll offset maps**: `Window.ScrollX()` and
  `Window.ScrollY()` now return `*BoundedMap[string, float32]` (was
  `*BoundedMap[uint32, float32]`). All `Window.Scroll*` methods
  (`ScrollHorizontalBy/To/ToPct/Pct`, `ScrollVerticalBy/To/ToPct/Pct`) and
  `FindLayoutByScrollID` (renamed from `FindLayoutByIDScroll`) take a `string`
  id.
- **BREAKING — Scrollbar/command-palette cfgs**: `ScrollbarCfg.IDScroll uint32`
  → `ScrollID string` (points at the target container's scroll key).
  `CommandPaletteShow`/`CommandPaletteToggle` drop the `idScroll` parameter;
  Show always resets the results scroll (keyed `id + ":scroll"`) to the top.
- **Scroll internals**: the scroll-offset maps are rekeyed uint32→string, which
  sidesteps the `BoundedMap[uint32]` generic lookup penalty
  ([#77](https://github.com/go-gui-org/go-gui/issues/77)); FnvSum32 scroll-hash
  derivation removed from Select, Combobox, DataGrid and the theme picker.
  `Shape` shrinks 272 → 264 bytes (this change −8 with the `IDScrollContainer`
  removal below).

### Removed

- Dead `Shape.IDScrollContainer uint32` field and its per-frame whole-tree
  `layoutScrollContainers` pass (zero readers).

### Added

- `BenchmarkViewFrame` gates `sizeof(Shape)` regressions by allocating Shapes
  inside the hot loop (added to the `bench-gate` target).

## [v0.34.0] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- **BREAKING — Focus API**: `Shape.IDFocus uint32` is replaced by
  `Focusable bool` plus string focus identity (the widget's `ID`). Tab order now
  follows layout-tree (DFS) order instead of ascending numeric IDs. Window API:
  `SetFocus(id string)`, `FocusID() string`, `IsFocus(id string)`, and
  `ClearFocus()` replace the uint32 variants. Migration: `IDFocus: N` →
  `Focusable: true` (with a non-empty `ID`); `SetIDFocus(0)` → `ClearFocus()`.
- **BREAKING — Widget cfgs**: `MenubarCfg`, `ContextMenuCfg`,
  `CommandPaletteCfg`, and `DataGridCfg` lose `IDFocus`; `DialogCfg.IDFocus` →
  `FocusID string`; `RadioButtonGroupCfg` gains `ID`; menus and context menus
  now require an `ID`. `CommandPaletteShow`/`CommandPaletteToggle` drop the
  `idFocus` parameter (focus derives from the palette input's ID).
- **Focus internals**: six per-window state namespaces rekeyed uint32→string;
  FnvSum32 focus-hash derivation removed from menus and datagrid (header/editor
  focus ids now derive from cell ID and column index). Duplicate focusable IDs
  collapse to one tab stop with a dev-mode warning (`GOGUI_FOCUS_DEBUG=1`).
  `IDScroll` is unchanged.

## [v0.33.1] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- **Dependencies**: go-glyph bumped to v1.16.2 — text symbols across many
  Unicode blocks (heavy asterisk U+2731 ✱, mahjong tiles, playing cards,
  alchemical and chess symbols, Supplemental Arrows-C, ~760 codepoints) no
  longer render as the base font's `.notdef` tofu box, and default-text emoji
  such as U+2733 ✳, ❄, ❤, ☀ now render as monochrome text glyphs instead of
  being forced to color, matching Core Text and Ghostty. Also propagates
  InlineObject metadata through rich-text layout and applies script fallback in
  `LayoutRichText`.

## [v0.32.1] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- **Dependencies**: go-glyph bumped to v1.16.1 — text symbols such as U+23F5 ⏵
  (the Misc Technical media triangles) no longer render as the base font's
  `.notdef` tofu box; they now fall back to a real glyph (STIX), matching Core
  Text.

## [v0.32.0] - 2026-07-12

### Changed

- **Dependencies**: go-glyph bumped to v1.16.0 — supplies a recommended line
  height (`TextMetrics.LineHeight`: font leading floored to 1.15×em) and no
  longer discards leading in multi-line layout, so wrapped text stacks with
  correct spacing. Regenerates `docs/dependencies.md`.
- **Markdown defaults**: removed the manual paragraph `LineSpacing = 3`
  workaround in `DefaultMarkdownStyle`; line spacing now comes from the font's
  recommended line height provided by go-glyph.

### Fixed

- **gl backend**: populate `MouseDX`/`MouseDY` on motion events so scrollbar
  thumb drags track the pointer. (#66)
- **svg**: reject non-finite `tx`/`ty` in `decomposeTRS`. (#67)

## [v0.31.0] - 2026-07-11

### Changed

- **Dependencies**: go-glyph bumped to v1.15.0 — pure-Go text backends on Linux,
  Android, macOS, and Windows (`go-text/typesetting` + `x/image/vector`,
  `CGO_ENABLED=0`), replacing the cgo FreeType+HarfBuzz stack. Pulls in
  `go-text/typesetting` and `golang.org/x/image` as indirect deps; regenerates
  `docs/dependencies.md`. Drops the obsolete Android native-deps build step from
  CI/release workflows.
- **Markdown defaults**: paragraph `LineSpacing` reduced to 3 and `BlockSpacing`
  raised to 12 so inter-block gaps stay larger than intra-line gaps (fixes
  cramped spacing between wrapped list items).

### Fixed

- **Markdown line spacing**: `TextStyle.LineSpacing` now applies to wrapped
  rich-text (RTF) rendering. Line spacing lives on glyph's `BlockStyle`, so
  `ToGlyphStyle` dropped it and markdown paragraph/list line spacing was a
  no-op; the value is now carried through both RTF layout paths.

## [v0.30.2] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- **Dependencies**: go-glyph bumped to v1.14.0. Regenerates
  `docs/dependencies.md` to match.

### Removed

- Remove all SDL2 vestiges from the codebase.
- Trim vestigial MSYS2 packages from Windows CI.

## [v0.30.1] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- **Dependencies**: go-glyph bumped to v1.13.1 (Windows proportional-font
  substitution now falls back to Consolas; internal draw/renderer dedup between
  the FreeType and Darwin backends). Regenerates `docs/dependencies.md` to
  match.

## [v0.30.0] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- **Dependencies**: go-glyph bumped to v1.13.0 (FreeType+HarfBuzz replaces
  Pango/SDL2, native GLX+WGL backends, ASCII monospace shaping fast-path on
  Darwin). The prior v2.0.0 tag was retracted — it lacks the `/v2` module path
  suffix required by Go module conventions.

### Added

- **Window vibrancy** (macOS): `Window.SetWindowVibrancy(VibrancyMaterial)`
  places a translucent, blurred native `NSVisualEffectView` backdrop behind the
  window content. Pair with a translucent `WindowCfg.BgColor` (alpha < 255) to
  reveal the backdrop; `VibrancyNone` restores an opaque window. Implemented on
  the Metal backend (makes the window and its `CAMetalLayer` non-opaque so
  content composites over the blur); no-op on SDL2, OpenGL, web, iOS, and
  Android (Linux/Windows are out of scope, matching the `TermGrid` issue). Built
  for go-term. See `examples/vibrancy`. (#31)
- **`TermGrid` primitive**: a terminal character-grid widget
  (`TermGrid`/`TermGridCfg`) that draws a fixed-pitch cell buffer in a single
  `RenderTermGrid` command — no per-cell `Layout` node and no per-cell
  `RenderText`. Callers hand over a row-major `[]TermCell` with pre-resolved
  RGBA foreground/background, plus cursor and selection state; the backend
  batches same-background runs into fills and pins glyphs to exact cell columns
  via `DrawLayoutPlaced`. Honors the reverse and underline attributes;
  bold/italic are reserved in `TermAttr` for a follow-up. Rendered by the Metal
  and SDL2 backends (OpenGL out of scope). Built for go-term and reusable across
  siblings. See `examples/termgrid`. (#30)

### Fixed

- **GL backend**: narrow build tags from `!js` to `!js && !darwin` on the real
  implementation files so they don't compile on macOS where `platform_other.go`
  returns nil. Eliminates 50 unused-code lint warnings on the default dev
  platform. macOS uses Metal, not GL.
- **Native dialogs**: track native (OS) modal visibility so `DialogIsVisible`
  and the quit/close dedup see `NSAlert`-style dialogs too. Previously a native
  confirm-before-quit could stack a duplicate dialog because the second
  quit/close re-invoked `OnCloseRequest`. `DispatchCloseRequest` now guards its
  hook path while a dialog is showing (the no-hook path still closes). (#18)
- **Modal dialogs**: retain keyboard focus inside an in-app modal dialog when a
  focus-claiming widget (one that re-asserts `SetIDFocus` every view rebuild)
  tries to steal it, so Tab/Esc/Enter keep working. Apps no longer need to guard
  their own `SetIDFocus` with `DialogIsVisible`. (#18)

## [v0.29.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **`TextStyle.EmojiBoxWidth`**: optional target cell-box width (logical px),
  threaded through `ToGlyphStyle` and the GPU backend draw path
  (`GuiStyleToGlyphConfig`). When > 0, go-glyph scales color/emoji glyphs to
  fill the caller's cell box instead of the font's natural emoji advance. Used
  by grid callers such as go-term. Requires go-glyph v1.12.0.

## [v0.28.2] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **macOS Metal backend**: complete the Launch Services launch handshake so a
  `.app` bundle launched from Finder is fully registered as a foreground app —
  fixes absence from Cmd+Tab, gray titlebar buttons, and the
  double-click-to-close behavior. Restore `activateIgnoringOtherApps:` for the
  CLI-launch case so bare-exec windows come up active.
- **macOS Metal backend**: fire `EventFocused` on `applicationDidBecomeActive:`
  so keyboard and left-click input are restored after a system dialog (e.g. TCC
  permissions) is dismissed, and re-key the frontmost window when `keyWindow` is
  nil on app switch.
- **DockLayout**: enlarge the tab close button (14×14 → 18×18) with a larger ×
  glyph, and add a spacer between the tab label and close button.

### Changed

- **macOS Metal backend**: cache NSCursor selector C strings once at startup to
  drop per-frame `C.CString` alloc/free from the cursor-update hot path.
- **macOS Metal backend**: rename app-launch entry points to reflect their
  lifecycle stage (`metalAppInit` / `metalAppFinishLaunch`) and dedupe the
  wake-event construction and activation-focus paths.

## [v0.28.1] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **macOS Metal backend**: `finishLaunching` deferred until after first window
  is created, fixing off-screen windows when launched as a `.app` bundle via
  Finder/Launch Services.

## [v0.28.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Native macOS backend**: new Metal-based backend with native window
  management, event handling, cursor support, and menu integration via AppKit.
  Replaces the SDL2 backend on macOS for proper platform behavior.
- **DockLayout**: `HideSingleTab` option hides the tab bar when only one tab is
  present.

### Changed

- **Performance**: content dimensions and sibling sums cached during fill pass
  to avoid redundant recalculation during layout.

### Fixed

- **DockLayout**: close button rendered as × instead of an empty box.
- **WASM backend**: hardened against iPadOS Safari crashes.
- **SVG**: `arcToCubic` guarded against NaN/Inf radii and float32 overflow
  panic.
- **Website**: `status.html` included in deploy output.
- **Windows CI**: MSYS2 pinned to stable release.

## [v0.27.1] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **Windows CI**: pin MSYS2 to stable release to fix `__ms_vsscanf` undefined
  reference linker error with GCC 16.1.0.

## [v0.27.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- **Platform parity**: Save/Discard/Cancel close confirmations for unsaved
  changes, plus Windows system tray icon support.
- **Dialog quit guard**: quit requests are trapped when a modal dialog is
  visible, preventing accidental app termination.
- **Tooling spec**: automated linting, license checking, Renovate dependency
  management, and coverage reporting integrated into CI.
- **CI hardening**: race detector enabled, caching and cache-key rotation,
  deduplication, 800-line file-size gate, deadcode detection, `go mod tidy`
  check, fuzz-crash detection, and security scans (gosec).
- **Shared native-platform glue**: `App` native integration tests and extracted
  platform abstraction for backend consistency.

### Changed

- **Performance**: eliminated hot-path heap allocations across layout
  calculation, gesture hit-testing, render command generation, and event
  dispatch. Two-pass allocation scrub.
- **Lock splitting**: animation lock separated from layout lock; `w.mu` scope
  narrowed to reduce contention.
- **GPU backend consolidation**: shared `gpu` package for vertex types and draw
  code reused across Metal, OpenGL, and SDL2 backends.
- **Large-file refactoring**: 14 files over 800 lines split into 32 focused
  files; datagrid dot-imports removed; markdown fetcher uses dependency
  injection.
- **Dependencies**: go-glyph bumped to v1.10.0, golangci-lint to v2.12, GitHub
  Actions to latest major versions.
- **Test parallelization**: tests now run concurrently; per-package coverage
  floors enforced in CI.

### Fixed

- **macOS**: `NSApp` activated before window creation, fixing focus issues on
  launch.
- **DataGrid**: scroll position read from correct state map; `UpdateView` no
  longer clears `idFocus` on full rebuild.
- **SVG**: `arcToCubic` guarded against coincident endpoints (NaN from
  `Inf*0/1`).
- **GPU**: `gpu.Vertex` struct literals use keyed fields across all backends.
- **Web backend**: removed unused `syscall/js` import; restored `strconv`
  import.
- **Build tags**: drift corrected across source files and CHANGELOG.
- **Animation**: map data races fixed under concurrent access.
- **Windows**: `__ms_vsscanf` compat shim for MinGW GCC 15+; static builds and
  DLL alignment hardened; CI smoke test added.
- **Security**: 242 gosec issues resolved; G204 false positives suppressed on
  `exec.Command` calls; privacy audit and resource caps applied.
- **CI**: various workflow fixes — golangci-lint install path, tidy-check

## [v0.26.0] - 2026-06-12

### Breaking

- **DataGrid moved to `gui/datagrid/`** — `DataGrid`, `DataGridCell`,
  `DataGridTheme`, and related symbols (~30) extracted from `gui/` into a
  separate package. Import `github.com/go-gui-org/go-gui/gui/datagrid` and use
  `datagrid.New()` instead of `gui.NewDataGrid()`.
- **SVG constant renames** — `StrokeCap` → `SvgStrokeCap`, `StrokeJoin` →
  `SvgStrokeJoin`, plus typed constants for stroke cap/join, spread method, and
  units. Callers using the old untyped string constants will need to update to
  the new typed values.
- **Spinner renamed to MathSpinner** — `gui.NewSpinner()` →
  `gui.NewMathSpinner()`. Disambiguates from future loading-spinner widget.

### Added

- `SvgAlignNone` now does non-uniform stretch with independent scaleX/scaleY
  instead of treating the SVG as xMidYMid.
- Backend `RunE`/`RunAppE` variants (gl, sdl2, metal, web) that return errors
  instead of panicking on init failure.

### Changed

- SVG path parser refactored into `pathParser` struct with per-command methods
  for lower allocation and better readability.
- Render validators and SVG element handlers extracted from large functions into
  focused helpers.
- `keyName` and `EventFn` complexity reduced via helper extraction.
- Showcase temp-file handling hardened, lazy-load abort wired, allocations
  simplified.

### Fixed

- Web backend build broken by `newBackend` return value mismatch and
  non-constant `fmt.Errorf` format strings.
- macOS linker duplicate `-lobjc` warnings suppressed via
  `-Wl,-no_warn_duplicate_libraries`.
- Web backend keyboard modifiers guarded against `KeyboardEvent` lacking
  `.buttons`.
- Web backend keydown/keyup registered on `document` instead of `canvas`, fixing
  focus-edge-case missed keys.
- Showcase wasm build missing `cleanupEmbeddedAssets` stub.
- Showcase audio made opt-in behind `audio` build tag, fixing Windows FLAC DLL
  issue (#8).
- CI showcase deploy race condition on GitHub Pages fixed.

## [v0.25.0] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

- Reduce exported API surface (~138 symbols removed) in preparation for v1.0.
  Numerous internal types, functions, constants, and methods made unexported.
  **Breaking:** callers importing removed symbols must update to use the
  remaining public API.

## [v0.24.8] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- iOS simulator .app artifact missing from GitHub Release (upload step was
  skipped in the release workflow).
- Android gomobile bind failing due to missing native dependencies (FreeType,
  HarfBuzz now built before bind step).
- Android gomobile bind failing due to missing golang.org/x/mobile tool
  dependency in release workflow.

### Added

- iOS simulator README bundled in the release artifact zip.

## [v0.24.6] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- Update roadmap platform table to reflect final build approaches.

## [v0.24.5] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Windows showcase binary (.zip with bundled SDL2 DLLs) published to GitHub
  Releases.

### Fixed

- Release workflow upload race (first-completed job published release before
  other jobs could attach assets). Restructured to build→artifact→publish
  pipeline.
- macOS release CI (`brew install sdl2 sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf sdl2_image`,
  `-bundle-deps` for self-contained .app).
- Linux release CI (added freetype6/harfbuzz/pango dev packages for go-glyph CGo
  compilation).
- Windows release CI (switched from go-sdl2 static libs to MSYS2 SDL2 packages
  to resolve MinGW `__ms_vsscanf` linker incompatibility).

## [v0.24.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- WASM showcase deployed to GitHub Pages at
  `https://go-gui-org.github.io/showcase/` with loading spinner and download
  progress indicator.
- Desktop binaries (macOS `.dmg`, Linux `.tar.gz`, Windows `.zip`) built and
  published as GitHub Release artifacts on `v*` tags.

### Changed

- Release workflow now builds all four platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows, WASM)
  and uploads artifacts to the GitHub Release.

## [v0.23.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- `ListBoxCfg.Items []string` — convenience field; each string becomes a
  `ListBoxOption` with `ID==Name==Value`.
- `RadioButtonGroupCfg.Items []string` — convenience field; each string becomes
  a `RadioOption` with `Label==Value`.
- `TableCfg.RawData [][]string` — convenience field for CSV-style data. First
  row is treated as the header.
- `TreeCfg.ItemPaths []string` — convenience field for flat path strings
  (`"a/b/c"`), auto-expanded into nested `TreeNodeCfg` nodes with duplicate
  prefix merging.
- `DataGridCfg.RowsData []map[string]string` — convenience field for key-value
  row data. Map keys match column IDs. Columns are auto-generated from sorted
  keys of the first entry when `Columns` is empty.

### Changed

- When both the stdlib convenience field and the typed struct field are set, the
  stdlib field takes precedence.

## [v0.22.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Single-binary deploy on Linux and Windows via `go-sdl2 -tags static`,
  eliminating the `libSDL2.so` / `SDL2.dll` runtime dependency.
- Root `Makefile` with `build-linux`, `build-windows`, `build-macos`,
  `build-wasm`, `release`, and `clean` targets.
- `gui.Version` and `gui.Commit` build-time variables injected via `-ldflags`.
- CI release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) triggered on `v*` tags
  and `workflow_dispatch`, building all desktop platforms.

## [v0.21.1] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Hunspell spellcheck is now opt-in via `-tags hunspell` build tag on Linux,
  avoiding a hard runtime dependency on `libhunspell`.

### Changed

- Remove local `replace` directive for `go-glyph` — the module now consumes
  upstream `go-glyph` directly.
- Add Dependabot config for `go-glyph` dependency updates.

## [v0.21.0] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Module path renamed from `github.com/mike-ward/go-gui` to
  `github.com/go-gui-org/go-gui`.
- `go-glyph` dependency bumped to v1.9.0.
- Repository moved to `go-gui-org` GitHub organization.

### Added

- Benchmark and inspector screenshots in README.

## [v0.20.2] - 2026-05-24

### Changed

- Bump `go-glyph` dependency to v1.8.0.

## [v0.20.1] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- `DrawContext.Scale` (device pixel ratio) is now correctly populated from the
  backend's DPI scale and included in the `DrawCanvasCache` key, so a canvas is
  re-tessellated when the display scale changes (e.g. window moved between
  Retina and non-Retina monitors).
- All backends (gl, metal, sdl2) now refresh `dpiScale` on window resize, so
  display migration no longer leaves a stale scale for the lifetime of the
  window.
- Web backend now sets `w.BackingScale` each frame; previously
  `DrawContext.Scale` was always 1 on web regardless of `devicePixelRatio`.
- Scale sanitization guard relaxed from `< 1` to `<= 0`, allowing valid sub-1
  device pixel ratios (e.g. browser zoomed below 100%) to pass through.

## [v0.20.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- RTF widgets with `IDFocus` set now support interactive text selection: click
  to place cursor, drag to extend selection (with scroll-aware auto-scroll),
  double-click to select word, keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Home/End,
  Ctrl/Cmd+A), and Ctrl/Cmd+C to copy.
- Markdown widgets with `IDFocus` set gain the same selection and copy
  capability across all block types (paragraphs, headings, lists, blockquotes,
  definition terms/values). Selection uses a unified rune-offset model so Cmd+C
  copies the correct cross-block span.

## [v0.19.1] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- Metal backend: scroll phase bridge (`scroll_phase_darwin`) fires
  `EventScrollBegan` when a momentum scroll starts on macOS.

### Fixed

- Context menu: focus is now restored on dismiss; a second right-click no longer
  clobbers the saved focus state.

## [v0.19.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- Animation heartbeat is now view-bound: orphaned animations (whose owning
  layout is no longer present in the view tree) are automatically cancelled,
  preventing runaway tickers in long-lived windows.

### Fixed

- Metal backend: per-frame autorelease pool now spans the full frame
  (`metalBeginFrame` → `metalEndFrame`). Command buffers, render pass
  descriptors, encoders, and one-off `MTLBuffer` allocations were accumulating
  in the thread's ambient pool indefinitely (Go threads have no runloop). Uses
  `objc_autoreleasePoolPush`/`Pop` (ARC-compatible).

## [v0.18.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- `OnKeyUp` callback on Input widgets; `KeyUp` event dispatched through
  `Window.EventFn` mirrors the existing `OnKeyDown` pipeline.
- `key_up_demo` example demonstrating `KeyUp` event flow.

### Changed

- Extracted `ScrollDeltaHome` constant (replaces magic number `10_000_000`).
- Added `hasAnyModifiers()` helper and `inputTextChange()` function to reduce
  complexity in `makeInputOnChar()`; modernized loops with `slices.Backward`.

### Fixed

- Context menu no longer hijacks `IDFocus` on right-click. Pre-open focus is
  saved in `nsContextMenuFocus` (survives `dismissPopups`) and restored on
  action selection; `menuItemClick` only resets focus to zero when no action
  callback changed it.

## [v0.17.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- `AppFontPaths` registry lets apps declare custom font search paths before
  window creation. SDL2/Metal/GL backends load the registry at backend init so
  glyph rasterization picks up app-bundled fonts without ad-hoc backend hooks.

### Changed

- Bumped `github.com/go-gui-org/go-glyph` to `v1.7.0`.

### Fixed

- Inline math (markdown RTF render) now uses the per-`InlineObject`
  Height/Offset when available, preserving true aspect ratio for tall constructs
  like fractions and integrals. Previously height was clamped to line-height
  (ascent+descent), squashing oversize glyphs. Legacy entries without `Object`
  keep the old line-height fallback.

## [v0.16.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- `<use>` referencing `<symbol viewBox=...>` now honors `preserveAspectRatio`.
  Default is `xMidYMid meet` (uniform scale + center) per SVG 1.1;
  `preserveAspectRatio="none"` opts back into legacy independent-axis stretch;
  `slice` uses uniform max-scale and now mints a synthesized `clipPath` covering
  the `<use>` box so overflow from max-scale is cropped per spec. Author
  `clip-path=` on the `<use>` itself wins over the synth clip. Earlier impl
  always stretched and never clipped slice overflow.
- `clip-path` and `filter` now participate in the cascade: CSS rules
  (`<style>.cls { clip-path: url(#cp) }`) and inline `style=""` declarations set
  them, not only the bare presentation attribute. `clip-path: none` /
  `filter: none` clear inherited values per cascade origin precedence.
- Distinct elements sharing one `filter="url(#X)"` now composite as separate
  offscreen groups in document order. Previously they were merged by FilterID
  and z-ordered against unfiltered siblings incorrectly. Each occurrence carries
  a per-element `FilterGroupKey` (parser counter assigned during cascade).
- Nested `<svg>` elements now establish a child viewport. `x`, `y`, `width`,
  `height` accept user-space units or percentages of the parent viewport; an
  inner `viewBox` (with `preserveAspectRatio` meet/slice/none) composes onto the
  cascaded transform from the element's own `transform=` attr. Descendants
  inherit paint and cascade through the wrapper. Previously the inner subtree
  was dropped silently.
- Nested `<svg>` viewports now synthesize a rectangle clip-path in outer-parent
  coordinates so descendants outside the authored viewport rect are masked at
  tessellation time (default `overflow:hidden` for `<svg>`). Sibling viewports
  mint distinct ids; doubly-nested viewports cascade the innermost clip onto
  descendants. `<clipPath>`, `<linearGradient>`, and `<filter>` defs inside a
  nested `<svg>` reach the global registry. Empty or zero-area viewports skip
  emission. When the inner `<svg>` carries an authored `clip-path` (presentation
  attr / CSS / inline style), the synth viewport clip is suppressed so the
  asset's explicit semantic survives — true intersection of viewport and author
  clip awaits a multi-clip renderer.
- `gui.PreserveAlignFractions` exported (was `preserveAlignFractions`) so
  `gui/svg` can resolve `preserveAspectRatio` align fractions without
  duplicating the switch.

### Hardened

- SMIL `from`/`to`/`by`/`values` reject malformed tokens (NaN, Inf, garbage)
  instead of coercing to 0. Bogus 0 endpoints would previously synthesize real
  animation timelines; now the timeline drops. Color keyframe stops with invalid
  paint also drop the whole color timeline.
- `<use>` `symbolViewportScale` rejects degenerate viewBox (`<= 0` width/height)
  and clamps combined translate (`tx+ax`, `ty+ay`) via `boundedScale` so
  alignment offsets cannot push the transform past `±maxCoordinate`.
- Nested-`<svg>` viewport math sanitizes NaN, ±Inf, and oversized inputs on
  `x`/`y`/`width`/`height`, `viewBox`, `parent.W`/`parent.H`, and the resulting
  scale/translate so a poisoned attribute cannot propagate non-finite values
  into the path transform. Percentages parse via float64 so `1e30%` no longer
  truncates to ±Inf before scaling.
- `mixOptsHash` clamps `HoveredElementID` / `FocusedElementID` via
  `clampElementID` (256-byte cap) before the FNV mix. Hostile callers passing
  megabyte-sized pseudo-state IDs can no longer burn CPU in the cache lookup
  hash phase; downstream `parseSvgWith` already clamped, so cache key and parsed
  state stay in sync.
- Inline-SVG cache `sourceKey` now hashes the source via SHA-256 instead of
  retaining the raw string. With the 4 MB parse cap and 512 cache slots, the
  prior format pinned up to 2 GB of source retention from cache keys alone.
  Hashing is incremental (no `[]byte(data)` copy) and produces a fixed 71-byte
  key.
- `mintUseSliceClipID` (slice `<use>` clip emitter) rejects non-finite or
  out-of-range `viewBox` numbers explicitly before falling back to viewBox dims
  for missing `<use>` width/height; a hostile `viewBox="0 0 NaN Inf"` can no
  longer survive `<= 0` coercion and propagate into the clip rect.
- Synthesized slice-clip ids (`__use_clip_N`) now skip any id already present in
  the document index, so an authored `id="__use_clip_1"` cannot silently shadow
  or be shadowed by the synthesized rect. Synth ids remain monotonic so two
  synth ids never collide with each other.
- `clampCycle` rejects NaN explicitly (NaN compares false against both `<= 0`
  and `> maxCycleSec`, so it would otherwise fall through unchanged into
  downstream cycle/floor math). `parseTimeValue` layers `finiteF32` so
  `dur="NaN"` / `dur="1e9999s"` cannot reach cycle math even if `parseF32` ever
  loosens.
- `parseKeySplinesIfSpline` switches to `parseFloatStrict` and rejects control
  points outside `[0, 1]`. `parseF32` would coerce `NaN`/`Inf` tokens to 0 and
  slip past the range check, silently producing wrong easing on hostile
  authoring.
- `parseAnimateDashArrayElement` defers `flat` allocation until stride is known
  from the first frame, sizing it to `len(frames) × stride` instead of
  `len(frames) × SvgAnimDashArrayCap` (4× less waste for the common stride=2
  case).
- `Parser.animatedScratch` pool is now bounded by `maxAnimatedScratchCap` (4096)
  on both ends. `putAnimatedScratch` rejects oversized buffers so one
  pathological frame cannot pin a giant backing array; `getAnimatedScratch`
  clamps `minCap` so a hostile SVG with synthesized millions of animated paths
  cannot force a giant `make` per frame.
- `findAttr` reverses the five entity escapes emitted by `buildOpenTag`
  (`&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&#39;`) before returning attribute
  values. `encoding/xml` decodes attribute entities once, so without this
  reversal a legitimate `&` in an attribute round-tripped as the literal
  sequence `&amp;` and reached downstream parsers (color, url, id, transform) as
  garbage. Unknown entities pass through unchanged; allocation occurs only when
  at least one `&` is present.
- `decodeSvgTree` now accumulates per-node CharData into a parallel stack of
  `strings.Builder` frames instead of `top.Text += s` / `last.Tail += s`. A
  hostile `<text>` body fragmented into many small chunks (e.g. by sprinkling
  numeric entity refs) was O(N²) under the prior incremental concat; the builder
  rewrite is linear. Tail accumulation flushes to `Children[idx].Tail` before
  the next sibling append so a slice grow cannot strand pending tail data.

### Fixed

- `<text>` now routes through the CSS cascade like shapes, so author rules
  (`text { fill: ... }`), `:hover` / `:focus` matches, and `display:none` apply.
  Previously `<text>` only saw inherited computed style with no per-element rule
  matching.
- Invalid color syntax (e.g. `fill="#GGGGGG"`, `fill="rgb(abc,def,ghi)"`,
  `stroke=""`) is now ignored by the cascade per CSS "invalid → ignore", letting
  inherited paint survive instead of clobbering with transparent black.
  `parseHexColor` rejects non-hex digits; `parseRGBColor` rejects non-numeric
  channels.
- CSS-wide control keywords (`inherit`, `unset`, `revert`, `revert-layer`) on
  `fill` / `stroke` are no-ops so the cascade- copied parent paint survives.
  `<text stroke="inherit">` with no ancestor stroke now falls back to a visible
  default rather than being silently dropped.
- `<text>` now inherits `stroke` / `stroke-width` from the cascade, and
  `stroke="inherit"` resolves against the cascade rather than forcing black.
  `<text stroke="none">` clears any ancestor stroke.
- `<tspan>` honors its own `stroke`, `stroke-width`, and `opacity` attrs instead
  of silently copying parent values. `opacity="50%"` on `<tspan>` now equals 0.5
  (matches CSS keyframe parity below).
- Mixed-content `<text>` runs preserve trailing and interleaved char data.
  `<text>A <tspan>B</tspan> C</text>` now renders all three runs; previously the
  trailing "C" was dropped because only pre-first-child `Leading` text was
  captured. New `xmlNode.Tail` field stashes post-child char data so
  `<use>`-cloned subtrees carry it through too.
- CSS `@keyframes { opacity: 50% }` now compiles to 0.5 (was 1.0).
  `compileOpacityTimeline` switched from `parseFloatTrimmed` to
  `parseOpacityNumber` so the static cascade and animated values agree on
  percentage notation.
- `Parser.InvalidateSvgSource` now correctly drops file-backed cache entries and
  every option-variant (FlatnessTolerance, HoveredElementID, FocusedElementID,
  PrefersReducedMotion). Prior impl reconstructed hashes from the path string
  alone, which never matched file entries (whose key mixes file contents) and
  only covered two of the option permutations. Walks the entry table by a stored
  `sourceKey` instead.
- `<use>` cloned subtrees no longer leak duplicate descendant ids. `stripID` is
  now recursive; previously only the clone root and (for `<symbol>` targets) its
  top-level children had their ids removed, so any nested id collided with the
  original and corrupted `url(#id)` resolution, CSS `#id` matching, and
  animation targeting.
- `<use width=W height=H>` of a `<symbol viewBox=...>` now scales the symbol's
  viewport to fill the requested box via a composed
  `translate · scale · translate(-vbX,-vbY)` transform. Width/height were
  previously dropped, so callers could not size symbol reuses.
- `clip-path` / `filter` declarations are now marked authored only after the
  value resolves to a usable `url(#id)` reference or the `none` keyword.
  Previously the cascade flipped the authored flag on property name alone, so
  `clip-path: bogus` could suppress the synthesized nested-`<svg>` viewport clip
  and `filter: bogus` could allocate a fresh per-occurrence offscreen group
  buffer for a declaration that contributed no actual filter.
- Markdown inline math (`$...$`) now renders after the async codecogs fetch
  completes. The cross-frame RTF layout cache key did not include diagram cache
  state, so the layout shaped on the first frame with the raw-LaTeX text
  fallback (cache=Loading) was reused after the fetch transitioned to Ready —
  the InlineObject placeholder was never emitted and `renderRtf` produced no
  `RenderImage`. New `rtfMathStateKey` mixes per-math-run State/Width/Height/DPI
  into the cache key so a Loading→Ready transition forces re-shape. Display math
  (`$$...$$`) was unaffected because it renders through the `Image` view, not
  RTF. FNV-1a constants in `view_rtf.go` extracted to package consts
  (`fnvOffset64`, `fnvPrime64`, `fnvFieldSep`).

### Security

- `<use x="…" y="…">` author values are parsed numerically instead of spliced
  into the synthesized transform attribute, closing an injection vector
  (`x="0)scale(99)"` previously emitted an extra `scale` into the transform
  list). Also rejects percentage `x`/`y` rather than treating "50%" as raw 50,
  and clamps `<use>`-vs- -viewBox scale to ±maxCoordinate to prevent
  pathological tiny viewBox dims from emitting absurd scale factors.
- `stroke-width` on `<text>` and `<tspan>` clamps NaN and negative values to 0
  via new `sanitizeStrokeWidth`. Negative widths are invalid per SVG spec; NaN
  propagation broke tessellation (uint8/uint16 casts implementation-defined, Inf
  coords break bbox math).
- `writeAttrEscaped` (used to reconstruct each element's `OpenTag` for
  substring-scanning helpers like `findAttr` / `findStyleProperty`) now also
  escapes `'` (`&#39;`) and `>` (`&gt;`). A hostile attribute value containing a
  single quote could previously smuggle a fake attribute past the cascade
  (`<rect note=" x='99' " x="1"/>` parsed as `x=99`). Both quote styles plus
  `<`/`>`/`&` are now escaped so no value can terminate the embedded attr or
  open a markup token.
- `parseSvg(string)` and `parseSvgDimensions(string)` now enforce the existing 4
  MB `maxSvgFileSize` cap. The cap was previously applied only to file-loaded
  content; callers passing arbitrarily large in-memory strings (e.g.
  network-fetched SVGs) bypassed it, letting unbounded `xml.CharData`
  accumulation and full-document scans run on hostile input. `parseSvg` returns
  an error; `parseSvgDimensions` truncates to the cap before probing.
- `clipPath` triangulation is now cached per `ClipPathID` for the duration of
  one `tessellatePaths` call. N paths sharing one complex `clipPath` previously
  triggered N full re-tessellations (`O(N · clipComplexity)` CPU DoS); the cache
  reduces this to one tessellation per unique id. Cache is `nil` when the
  graphic declares no `clipPath`s, so the common icon/spinner path takes no
  extra allocation.

## [v0.15.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- `<use href="#id">` (and `xlink:href`) resolution. The referenced subtree is
  cloned at parse time, wrapped in a synthesized `<g>` carrying a
  `translate(x,y)` transform plus the `<use>` presentation attrs (`fill`,
  `style`, `class`, ...). Cycles are guarded by a visited-set + depth-8 cap; the
  clone has its `id` stripped to avoid duplicate ids in the post-expansion tree.
- `<symbol>` is now honored as a `<use>` target — the symbol's children are
  inlined directly (the wrapper is dropped). Untargeted `<symbol>` elements
  continue to render no output. Symbol-level `viewBox` / `preserveAspectRatio`
  honoring is a future polish.
- `spreadMethod` on `<linearGradient>` and `<radialGradient>`: `pad` (default),
  `reflect` (triangle wave), `repeat` (sawtooth).
  `gui.SvgGradientDef.SpreadMethod` is the new field; the previous silent-pad
  behavior is the zero-value default so existing fingerprints stay stable.
- `gui.SvgCfg.FlatnessTolerance float32` — tessellation tolerance floor in
  viewBox units. Default 0 keeps the historic 0.15 floor. Plumbed via a new
  `SvgParseOpts.FlatnessTolerance` field and a `Window.LoadSvgWithOpts` method;
  the cache key tracks tolerance per quantized 1e-4 step.
- `gui.SvgCfg.HoveredElementID` / `FocusedElementID string` — drive CSS `:hover`
  / `:focus` matching for the SVG element with that id. Plumbed through
  `SvgParseOpts` into the cascade `MatchState`; cache invalidates per id
  transition.
- `examples/svg_use_symbol`, `examples/svg_gradient_spread`,
  `examples/svg_flatness`, `examples/svg_css_states`.

### Changed

- `gui.SvgGradientDef` gains a `SpreadMethod SvgGradientSpread` field. Keyed
  struct literals are unaffected; positional users in sibling repos must update.
- `gui.SvgParseOpts` gains `FlatnessTolerance float32`,
  `HoveredElementID string`, `FocusedElementID string`. Additive.
- `gui/svg.ParseOptions` mirrors the same additions.
- `gui/svg.VectorGraphic` gains `FlatnessTolerance float32`. Internal.
- `Window.LoadSvgWithOpts(src, w, h, opts SvgParseOpts)` is the new
  per-render-override entry point. `Window.LoadSvg` is unchanged.

### Deferred to v0.16.0

- Automatic mouse-driven hover detection on the `Svg` widget. v0.15.0 ships the
  parser/cascade/cache plumbing so apps can drive `HoveredElementID` themselves
  (e.g. by hit-testing `TessellatedPath.ContainsPoint`); built-in pointer
  tracking with internal hit-test on the widget will land in v0.16.0.
- `<symbol>` `viewBox` / `preserveAspectRatio` honoring.
- `spreadMethod`-aware stop-boundary subdivision (currently pad-clamped, so
  reflect/repeat AA at wrap points is slightly softer than at first/last stop).

## [v0.14.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- CSS sibling combinators: adjacent (`+`) and general sibling (`~`). Match
  engine (`gui/svg/css`) now takes a preceding-siblings slice alongside
  ancestors when resolving complex selectors.
- CSS attribute selectors: `[name]`, `[name=v]`, `[name~=v]`, `[name|=v]`,
  `[name^=v]`, `[name$=v]`, `[name*=v]`. Names are case-insensitive; values are
  case-sensitive (no `i`/`s` flag). `ElementInfo.Attrs map[string]string`
  carries the per-element attribute map; svg parser populates it from the raw
  open tag.
- CSS `:hover`, `:focus`, `:not(inner)` selectors — parser + matcher only.
  `Compound` gained `HoverPseudo`, `FocusPseudo`, `Not` fields; `ElementInfo`
  gained a `MatchState{Hover, Focus bool}` block. Build-time state can be set
  via `ElementInfo.State`; runtime mouse-event auto-toggle is deferred to
  v0.15.0.
- `:not()` is single-compound only — comma-list (`:not(.a, .b)`) and nested
  `:not(:not(...))` are deferred.
- `var(--name, fallback)` resolution. The fallback is itself resolved
  recursively (so `var(--a, var(--b, red))` works); recursion bounded at
  depth 32.
- `calc()` arithmetic: `+ - * /`, parens, units `px` and unitless. Mixed-unit
  operands and divide-by-zero invalidate the declaration per spec. Nested
  `calc()` and `calc()` inside `var()` fallback are resolved.
- `examples/svg_css_selectors`, `examples/svg_css_vars` — visual demos for the
  new selector and value-resolution machinery.

### Changed

- `css.Match()` and `css.ComplexSelector.Matches()` gained a
  `siblings []ElementInfo` parameter. The sole external caller in
  `gui/svg/style.go` is updated; sibling repos (go-glyph, go-charts, go-edit,
  go-kite) do not call into `gui/svg/css` directly. Internal test sites pass
  `nil` for the new param.
- `Compound`, `ElementInfo`, `MatchedDecl` gained additive fields. Keyed struct
  literals are unaffected.
- `gui/svg.makeElementInfo()` signature gained an `attrs map[string]string`
  parameter (the parsed open-tag attributes).
- The CSS package status table in `docs/svg-support.md` flips several rows from
  "No" to "Yes" (sibling combinators, attribute selectors, `:not()`, `var()`
  fallback, `calc()`).

### Deferred to v0.15.0

- `:hover` / `:focus` runtime mouse-event auto-toggle. The selector is
  recognized today; v0.15.0 will wire the dispatcher (sits at the `gui` ↔
  `gui/svg` ↔ backend interface boundary, lands cleanly alongside
  `<use>`/`<symbol>` dynamic-cascade work).
- `examples/svg_css_states` — depends on the runtime auto-toggle.

## [v0.13.0] - unreleased

### Added

- SVG accessibility metadata. `<title>`, `<desc>`, `aria-label`,
  `aria-roledescription`, and `aria-hidden` on the root `<svg>` are now parsed
  and exposed via `SvgParsed.A11y` (new `SvgA11y` nested struct). Previously
  dropped silently.
- `<radialGradient>` is now parsed and rendered. Supports
  `cx`/`cy`/`r`/`fx`/`fy` in `objectBoundingBox` (default) or `userSpaceOnUse`.
  Stops use the same semantics as linear gradients. Focal interpolation uses a
  simplified distance-from-focal model; full SVG cone-focused projection is
  noted as future polish in `docs/svg-support.md`.
- `preserveAspectRatio` is now honored on the root `<svg>`. All 9 alignment
  values (`xMin`/`Mid`/`Max` × `YMin`/`Mid`/`Max`) plus `meet`/`slice` are
  supported. The default (`xMidYMid meet`) is unchanged from prior behavior, so
  existing SVGs render identically. `none` (non-uniform stretch) currently falls
  back to default — adding non-uniform render support is tracked as polish.
- `(*TessellatedPath).ContainsPoint(px, py)` for hit-testing filled SVG paths.
  `TessellatedPath` now carries a precomputed bbox (`MinX`/`MinY`/`MaxX`/`MaxY`)
  for fast reject. Author base transforms are inverted before the barycentric
  triangle test. Stroke contributions are skipped — pass the fill
  `TessellatedPath` for hit-testing.
- `examples/svg_a11y`, `examples/svg_radial`, `examples/svg_aspect`,
  `examples/svg_hittest` — visual demos for each new feature.

### Changed

- `SvgParsed`, `TessellatedPath`, and `CachedSvg` gained additive fields. Keyed
  struct literals are unaffected; positional literals would need to be updated
  (none found in tree or sibling repos — go-glyph, go-charts, go-edit, go-kite).

## [v0.12.7] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- SVG fingerprint goldens (`TestPhase0SmilSpinnerFingerprint`,
  `TestPhaseGCssSpinnerFingerprint`) failed on Linux/WASM CI because amd64 ships
  an asm `math.Sin`/`math.Cos` while arm64 uses pure-Go — ULP-level drift in
  trig output flipped digest bits versus the darwin-generated goldens.
  `hashTessellated` / `hashAnimations` now quantize finite floats to a 1e-3 grid
  before `Float32bits`, so the fingerprints stay platform-stable while still
  catching real geometry regressions. Goldens regenerated.

## [v0.12.6] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- `SvgSpinner` widget for animated SVG loaders. Full SMIL pipeline: `animate`,
  `animateTransform` (rotate/translate/scale), `animateMotion`, per-shape
  animation keying, attribute overrides, spline easing, syncbase `begin` timing,
  dash animations, TRS-sandwich transforms, and per-role opacity. CSS pipeline
  added: cascade, `@keyframes`, `@media`, animation shorthand. Ships with 39
  spinner assets across the SMIL and CSS sets. See `examples/showcase` for the
  live gallery.
- `TessellateAnimated` plus parse benchmarks for the SVG path/anim pipeline.
- Standalone XML tree parser with per-path animation routing.

### Changed

- SVG parser correctness and performance improvements: scanline fill-rule,
  `Z`-then-`M` path parse fix, dead `GroupID` stripped from
  `TessellatedPath`/`CachedSvgPath`, deduped float helpers, hardened animation
  pipeline.
- Ear-clip tessellator capped at 2048 verts to keep CI under timeout.
- README rewritten: accurate why-go-gui section, spinners video, formatting
  fixes, immediate-mode framing toned down.

## [v0.12.5] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- `Animation.Update` now takes `*AnimationCommands` instead of
  `*[]queuedCommand`. `queuedCommand` was always unexported, which made the
  `Animation` interface effectively impossible for third- party packages to
  implement — they could not name the parameter type. `AnimationCommands` wraps
  the deferred command queue behind two public methods:
  - `AppendOnDone(fn func(*Window))` — queues a terminal callback.
  - `AppendOnValue(fn func(float32, *Window), v float32)` — queues a per-frame
    interpolated-value callback. All existing first-party animations (`Animate`,
    `SpringAnimation`, `TweenAnimation`, `KeyframeAnimation`,
    `LayoutTransition`, `HeroTransition`, `BlinkCursorAnimation`) updated;
    callers of the stable concrete factories (`NewSpringAnimation`, etc.) see no
    change. Breaking only for downstream code that implemented `Animation`
    directly — impossible to do before this release, so no real-world migration.

## [v0.12.4] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- Per-call image fetcher on `DrawContext`. New
  `DrawContext.ImageWithFetcher(..., fetcher ImageFetcher)` and matching
  `DrawCanvasImageEntry.Fetcher` field let each image draw override
  `WindowCfg.ImageFetcher` for its own download. Typical use: a map widget pairs
  each tile layer with its source-specific User-Agent (OSM-policy UA for one
  layer, a WMS-provider UA for another) without a shared composite fetcher.
  Existing `DrawContext.Image` is unchanged and still routes through the
  window-level fetcher.
- New exported `ImageFetcher` function type and
  `ResolveImageSrcWithFetcher(w, src, fetcher)` helper. Existing
  `ResolveImageSrc(w, src)` is a thin wrapper that passes `nil`, so no caller
  needs to migrate.

### Notes

- Scope cut: `ImageCfg` (the Image widget) keeps the single-fetcher path.
  Per-widget fetcher override will land when a consumer demands it; no
  speculative API.
- Known limit: downloads are URL-keyed process-wide, so the first entry observed
  for a URL binds the fetcher for that URL's in- flight download. Consumers
  wiring two fetchers to overlapping URL namespaces must route by URL prefix
  themselves.

## [v0.12.3] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- `renderDrawCanvas` now emits images before triangle batches and text, so
  `DrawCanvas` consumers that compose tile backgrounds with `DrawContext`
  overlays get the correct z-order. Previously images painted on top of every
  batch/text in the same canvas — invisible in unit tests that only inspect
  `Texts()`/`Batches()` but user- visible once a tile-map demo ran in a window

### Changed

- SDL2 / GL / Metal backends now forward high-resolution
  `MouseWheelEvent.PreciseX` / `PreciseY` for smooth-scroll devices (trackpad
  pixel-scroll, Magic Mouse, high-res wheels), falling back to integer `X`/`Y`
  when the precise field is zero or the SDL runtime predates 2.0.18. Enables
  sub-integer scroll deltas in consumers that accumulate fractional `ScrollY`

## [v0.12.2] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Image download pipeline now handles remote URLs for `DrawContext.Image`.
  Shared `ResolveImageSrc(w, src)` resolves http/https URLs to local cache
  paths, schedules background downloads when uncached, and returns "" while in
  flight. `gui.Image` and `emitDrawCanvasImages` both route through it so
  DrawCanvas tiles render after the first fetch
- `WindowCfg.ImageFetcher` hook: apps can supply a custom HTTP client to set
  User-Agent, auth headers, or route through a shared pool. Default fetcher
  sends `User-Agent: go-gui/vX.Y.Z` so providers (e.g. OSM) can identify traffic
- `WindowCfg.MaxImageDownloads`: process-wide cap on concurrent image downloads.
  Defaults to 6; first-window-wins for sizing
- Exported `Version` const tracks the module tag

### Fixed

- HTTP status codes are now checked before the body is written to disk. Non-200
  responses (4xx/5xx) no longer poison the cache with error-page payloads

### Changed

- `downloadImage` dropped the HEAD pre-flight and validates size/content-type on
  the GET response. Single round trip per fetch

### Performance

- `ResolveImageSrc` caches the URL→path mapping per window so already-resolved
  tiles skip the `MkdirAll` + `Stat` syscalls each frame. Critical for
  DrawCanvas-based tile maps that render dozens of images per frame at 60fps

## [v0.12.1] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- DrawCanvas: `DrawContext.Image(x, y, w, h, src, bgOpacity, bgColor)` draws
  images inside the canvas via the same deferred-emit pipeline as text. `src`
  accepts the same forms as `ImageCfg.Src` (local path, http/https URL, data
  URL)
- DrawCanvas: `DrawCanvasCfg.IDFocus` and `OnKeyDown` enable keyboard focus and
  key event handling. A11Y role flips to button when the canvas is focusable

## [v0.12.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- Time-travel debugging: opt-in via WindowCfg.DebugTimeTravel. User state
  implements Snapshotter (Snapshot/Restore; optional Size). Framework captures a
  snapshot after every dispatched event; scrubber window auto-spawns alongside
  the app window with a slider, step buttons (first/prev/next/last), cause
  label, counter, freeze toggle, and keyboard shortcuts (arrows, home/end,
  space, esc)
- Window.Now() virtual clock: returns pinned snapshot timestamp during scrub,
  live time otherwise; use in view fns that render clock-driven data so scrubbed
  frames match their snapshot
- Window.EnableHistory(maxBytes), HistoryLen(), OpenDebugWindow(),
  Freeze/Resume/IsFrozen, PostRestore(idx) public API
- RegisterNamespaceSnapshot(ns): widget authors opt additional StateMap
  namespaces into scrub restore; scroll (nsScrollX/nsScrollY) and widget-local
  focus (nsInputFocus, nsListBoxFocus, nsTreeFocus) are pre-registered
- BoundedMap.cloneAny/restoreAny: type-preserving snapshot through an interface
  so whitelisted namespaces rewind without reflection
- examples/time_travel: counter demo wiring Snapshotter + DebugTimeTravel

### Hardening

- Snapshotter.Size() capped at 1 GiB to prevent totalBytes overflow
- Slider NaN/Inf rejected before int conversion in the scrubber
- BoundedMap restore recovers from type-assertion panics so a single out-of-sync
  namespace doesn't break the rest of the scrub
- Parent-window title truncated before composing the scrubber title

### Notes

- Read-only scrub only: rewinding state does not un-do past side effects (HTTP
  requests, file writes, sounds)
- Requires multi-window mode (App + App.OpenWindow). Single-window apps log a
  notice and no-op
- Zero-cost when disabled: nil-history check short-circuits the hot path with no
  allocation

## [v0.11.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- WindowCfg.OnCloseRequest hook: intercept OS window-close and app-quit events
  for save/discard/cancel prompts. Callback owns calling Window.Close() to
  proceed or doing nothing to cancel. Dispatch extracted into
  DispatchCloseRequest / DispatchQuitRequest helpers shared by sdl2/gl/metal
  backends.

## [v0.10.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- DockNode/SplitterState JSON serialization: struct tags, text-marshaled enums
  (DockNodeKind, DockSplitDir, SplitterOrientation, SplitterCollapsed),
  DockNodeSanitize for post-unmarshal hardening
- Showcase docs: new dock_layout component entry, splitter serialization section

### Changed

- SplitterStateNormalize handles NaN/Inf ratios and invalid Collapsed values
- Modernize: sync.OnceFunc/OnceValue, slices.SortStableFunc, cmp.Compare

## [v0.9.9] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

  on Cocoa-allocated string); per-window callback map for multi-window support

## [v0.9.8] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- File-drop event support: OnFileDrop callback on Container, DrawCanvas, and
  EventHandlers; SDL2 backend maps DropEvent to EventFileDropped

### Changed

## [v0.9.7] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- Bump go-glyph dependency from v1.6.4 to v1.6.5

  removal in render/image opacity, rotateCoordsInverse float path, stack-array
  cellContent, inspector cache map reuse
- Convert copy-paste spinner tests to table-driven
- Remove redundant state and unnecessary comments
- 42 files changed, −278 net lines

## [v0.9.5] - 2026-04-11

### Added

  widgets detect repeat callbacks within a render cycle

## [v0.9.4] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- `Window.SetTitle(string)` + `Window.SetTitleFn(func(string))` — dynamic OS
  window title updates. Wired in sdl2, metal, and gl backends via
  `sdl.Window.SetTitle`
- Input hardening on `SetTitle`: 4 KiB cap, UTF-8-safe truncation, embedded-NUL
  stripping; no-alloc fast path for clean short inputs

## [v0.9.3] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- `NativeSaveDiscardDialog` — Save / Don't Save / Cancel alert for
  unsaved-changes flows
- Native menubar: route macOS app-menu "About" through `OnAction`

### Changed

- License: PolyForm NC 1.0 → MIT

### Fixed

- Solitaire example: replace double-click auto-move with right-click
- CI: brew upgrade harfbuzz/pango text stack on macOS; checkout go-glyph for
  test job and use local replace directive

## [v0.9.2] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- `Window.TextMeasurer()` accessor for downstream widgets that need direct
  access to the backend measurer

  lexer set (go, python, js/ts, rust, c/cpp, java, ruby, shell, html, css, json,
  yaml, toml, sql, markdown, diff, dockerfile, make) and DoS caps (256KB source,
  100k tokens)
- `MarkdownStyle.CodeHighlighter` field: optional highlighter for fenced code
  blocks; nil preserves parser's built-in tokenizer
- `MarkdownStyle.CodeTypeColor`, `CodeFunctionColor`, `CodeBuiltinColor` palette
  fields
- Showcase: component docs, welcome, data grid features, markdown demo, and
  inspector overlay all use `highlight.Default()`

## [v0.8.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- `Spinner` widget: animated mathematical curve loading indicator with 21 named
  `CurveType` constants (rose, lissajous, hypotrochoid, butterfly, cardioid,
  lemniscate, epitrochoid, heart wave, spiral, fourier and variants)
- Spinner particle-trail rendering via `DrawCanvas` with faint ghost path
  outline
