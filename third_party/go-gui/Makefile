# Desktop builds are cgo-free since the purego GL bindings (#155): the
# backend/gl uses X11/xgb + purego EGL on Linux and Win32 syscalls on
# Windows. Only macOS (Metal) and the mobile backends need cgo.
# GOOS/GOARCH are explicit: without them a macOS developer running
# `make release` gets a Mach-O binary in the "linux" tarball.  The
# purego backend cross-compiles cleanly, so this costs nothing on a
# Linux host either.
# Both architectures on every desktop platform.  The cgo-free
# cross-compile costs almost nothing and it covers arm64 Linux servers
# and Windows on ARM, which amd64-only archives left with nothing to
# download.

# Packaging goes through cmd/buildapp on all three desktop targets, so
# each archive carries what its platform needs to look like an
# application: a .desktop entry and icon on Linux, an icon resource on
# Windows, a signed .app on macOS.
#
# Each binary is staged under its own build/pkg-* directory as plain
# "showcase" first, because buildapp takes the installed executable's
# name from the file's basename -- package it as "showcase-linux-amd64"
# and that string lands in the desktop entry's Exec= line.  buildapp
# reads the target architecture from the ELF/PE machine field, not from
# the name, so the two archives per platform get distinct names on their
# own.
#
# The release workflow calls these same targets, so CI and a local
# `make release` cannot drift apart.
