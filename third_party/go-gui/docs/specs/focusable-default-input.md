# Spec: `Focusable` defaults true for input controls (`FocusDisabled` opt-out)

Status: **implemented** — Phase 1 shipped v0.36.0 (Input, Select, Slider,
Toggle, Switch). Phase 2 shipped v0.37.0, dropping `Focusable bool` for
`FocusDisabled bool` on the remaining nine controls. Both phases in CHANGELOG.

Follow-up landed: the deferred bucket (Decision 8) is empty. `Combobox`,
`DatePicker`, `ListBox`, `RadioButtonGroup`, `NumericInput` and `InputDate` are
all focusable by default now, as are `Tree` and `ColorPicker` from the
borderline set (Decision 9) — twenty Cfgs in total. Only `ThemePicker` (and the
non-input opt-ins) keeps `Focusable bool`. The table and Decisions 8–9 below
keep their original verdicts as history; read them as landed.

Base: `main` @ `8522098` Target release: go-gui `v0.36.0` (breaking)

## Motivation

Nearly every interactive `InputCfg` site in-repo sets `Focusable: true`. The
exceptions are not designed non-focusable inputs but the two wrapper factories
(which pass `cfg.Focusable` through) and a couple of tests. Requiring the field
on every input is boilerplate that adds nothing — an input the user cannot tab
to is a bug, not a design choice. Flip the default: input controls are focusable
unless the caller opts out with `FocusDisabled`.

**Phase 2 is an accessibility change, not just deboilerplating.** `Select`,
`Slider`, `Toggle`, `Switch` are mostly _not_ focusable in-repo today (Slider:
0% set `Focusable: true`), so flipping them enrolls those controls in the Tab
order — the intended, correct behavior (a slider is keyboard-adjustable) — a
visible behavior change, not silent cleanup. Zero `Focusable: false` anywhere
(repo + all five siblings) confirms nobody relies on the opt-out, so the flip is
safe.

Scope caveat: focus still requires `s.ID != ""` (`layout_query.go:94`), so this
benefit only reaches **ID-bearing** call sites. `Slider`'s ID is
`gui:"required"` (always present). `Select`/`Toggle`/`Switch` IDs are optional,
so an ID-less one becomes a focusable-but-inert shape (renders, never a tab
stop) — consistent with the whole "no ID → inert" design, not a regression. The
a11y win lands where callers supply an ID. Encourage that in the field docs
(Phase 3). Do not force it.

This is **only a default flip**, not auto-generated identity. Focus still
requires a non-empty `ID` (`isFocusedTarget`: `Focusable && ID != ""`). A
defaulted-focusable input with no `ID` is **inert**: it renders, but holds no
focus, cursor, or state. That outcome is accepted: no ID → no state → the
control does not respond. No ID is ever fabricated, so the identity==state-key
invariant (see [idfocus-to-focusable.md](idfocus-to-focusable.md)) is untouched
and no state can be silently corrupted.

## Why `FocusDisabled bool`, not `Opt[bool]`

`Focusable bool` cannot default true (zero value is false) and cannot
distinguish "unset" from "explicitly false." Inverting to `FocusDisabled bool`
gives a zero-value default of _focusable_ and a single obvious opt-out. Because
the `Focusable` field is removed from in-scope Cfgs, the inversion turns every
existing `Focusable: true` on those Cfgs into a **compile error**, which is the
migration guide. It is preferred over `Opt[bool]`: no wrapper type, no `.Get()`
at every read, loud break at the call site.

## Decisions (locked)

1. In-scope Cfgs drop `Focusable bool`, add `FocusDisabled bool`. Factory sets
   `Shape.Focusable = !cfg.FocusDisabled`.
2. `Shape.Focusable bool` (runtime field) is **unchanged**. Only the Cfg-level
   field flips. Tab traversal, `isFocusedTarget`, and the `requiredid` analyzer
   are all keyed on `Shape`/literals and need no model change.
3. No auto-ID. No ID → inert. ID stays **optional** where it is optional today
   (Input) and stays **required** where `gui:"required"` already demands it
   (Slider, Combobox, DatePicker, Listbox — unchanged).
4. `Disabled` still excludes from tab order (`collectFocusCandidates` already
   gates `!Disabled`). `ReadOnly` still keeps the control focusable.
   `FocusDisabled` is orthogonal to both.
5. Out-of-scope widgets keep `Focusable bool` opt-in (Button, Container, Text,
   RTF, Markdown, DrawCanvas, TabControl, Splitter, Breadcrumb, OverflowPanel,
   TermGrid, Inspector, and standalone `Radio` — the `RadioButtonGroup`
   composite is deferred separately).
6. Clean break — no back-compat shim. All consumers are sibling repos owned by
   the same author (matches idfocus-to-focusable decision #5).
7. **Phase 1 and Phase 2 ship together** as a single `v0.36.0` migration (one
   break for consumers, not two).
8. **Composites and Input wrappers deferred, then landed** (Combobox,
   DatePicker, Listbox, RadioButtonGroup, **NumericInput, InputDate**) — each
   either governs focus over internal children or had a focus-model defect the
   flip exposed (see [Deferred — why](#deferred--why)). All six flipped in a
   follow-up; the bucket is empty.
9. **Borderline widgets stay opt-in** (ThemePicker) — `Tree` and `ColorPicker`
   landed in the follow-up; `ThemePicker` keeps `Focusable bool`.
10. **Analyzer stays silent** on an in-scope input with no `ID`. Inert is a
    valid choice. No positive lint.
11. **In-scope invariant** — a widget qualifies for the flip only if it (a)
    never fabricates a non-empty `ID` from an empty `cfg.ID`, and (b) exposes
    exactly **one** focus candidate (tab stop). Both are required so that "no ID
    → inert" holds and the flip adds no duplicate tab stops. Audited per widget
    below.

## In-scope widget set

Only widgets that satisfy the Decision-11 invariant are in scope. Audit against
the two failure modes (fabricated ID from empty `cfg.ID`, and more than one
focus candidate):

| `SelectCfg`                                                         | 1 (`cfg.ID`, dropdown never focusable)                     | no¹            | ✅ in — Phase 2       |

| `InputDateCfg`                                                      | 1, but inner Input `ID = cfgID+".input"` **ungated**       | **yes**        | ✅ landed (follow-up) |

¹ `SelectCfg.ID` is optional. An empty `ID` yields one _inert_ focus target but
its open-state (`nsSelect`) is keyed on `""` and thus shared across ID-less
Selects — a pre-existing quirk, not focus corruption. Passing an `ID` is
recommended in practice, not required for the flip.

**Phase 1:** `InputCfg` (single-line + multiline, the 96% case). **Phase 2:**
`SelectCfg`, `SliderCfg` (`gui:"required"` ID), `ToggleCfg`, `SwitchCfg`.

### Deferred — why (landed; kept as the defect record)

The two Input **wrappers** each broke the Decision-11 invariant and needed a
dedicated focus-model fix before they could flip. The fixes landed in the
follow-up; what follows is the defect record, not open work:

- **`InputDate`** — `inputDateTextField` sets the inner Input's `ID` to
  `cfgID + ".input"` unconditionally (`view_input_date.go:233`). With an empty
  `cfg.ID` that string is `".input"`, a fabricated non-empty ID. After the flip
  the inner Input becomes a live tab stop under `".input"`, two ID-less
  InputDates collide, and `nsInputDateText`/`nsInputDate` state keyed on `""` is
  shared — the exact corruption the invariant forbids. Same for
  `cfgID + ".picker"` (line 158). It also embeds the deferred `DatePicker`
  composite. Fix later: make `InputDateCfg.ID` required (it is stateful), or
  gate every derived ID on `cfg.ID != ""` the way `NumericInput` gates `_field`
  (`view_input_numeric.go:156`).
- **`NumericInput`** — with step buttons, the outer Row (`cfg.ID`, focusable)
  and the inner Input (`cfg.ID+"_field"`, focusable) are two distinct tab stops
  for one control. Not caused by the flip, but the flip makes it the default. A
  correct fix is non-trivial: the Row also takes clicks and calls
  `SetFocus(cfg.ID)`, while the editable state lives on `cfg.ID+"_field"`, so
  "just `FocusSkip` the Row" focuses the wrong shape. Rework so the inner Input
  is the sole tab stop and clicks focus it, then re-scope.

## Core changes

### Per in-scope Cfg

- Remove `Focusable bool`. Add `FocusDisabled bool`.
- Factory: every `Focusable: cfg.Focusable` → `!cfg.FocusDisabled`. `InputCfg`
  sets this on both the outer `Column` (tab stop) and the inner `Text` (which
  stays `FocusSkip` under the same `ID` → still one tab stop).
- Phase 2 controls each set it on their single focusable shape.

### Call-site migration (mandatory, same commit as the field removal)

Enumerate `InputCfg` construction sites with a command rather than a fixed count
(the count drifts — do not hardcode it):

```
rg -n '\bInputCfg\{' -g '*.go'      # Go literals (compile-relevant)
rg -n 'InputCfg\{' -g '*.md' docs README.md .claude   # docs/snippets
```

**The compiler is not a complete checklist.** Removing the field only breaks
literals that _write_ `Focusable:`. A literal that omits it compiles fine but
silently flips to focusable-by-default — a behavior change the build will not
flag. Markdown snippets never compile at all. Review **every** `InputCfg`
literal the commands list, not just the ones that error. Each must be rewritten
in the same phase so the repo compiles and the gate passes:

- Literal `Focusable: true` → **delete the line** (now the default. These
  widgets keep an `ID`, so behavior is unchanged).
- `Focusable: <expr>` → `FocusDisabled: !<expr>`.

**Critically, the deferred wrappers and other internal factories that build an
`InputCfg` must translate, not drop, their focus intent** — else the deferred
bug (Decision 11 / [Deferred — why](#deferred--why)) ships early:

```go
// view_input_date.go, view_input_numeric.go — stays opt-in:
Input(InputCfg{ ..., FocusDisabled: !cfg.Focusable })
```

Internal `gui/` factories to migrate in Phase 1 (all currently pass
`Focusable: true` or `cfg.Focusable`): `view_input_numeric.go`,
`view_input_date.go`, `view_color_picker.go` (×2), `view_command_palette.go`,
`view_dialog.go`, and `datagrid/` (`data_source_grid.go`,
`view_data_grid_edit.go`, `_events.go`, `_header.go`, `_pager.go`). Internal
Inputs that set `Focusable: true` drop the line. The two wrappers use
`FocusDisabled: !cfg.Focusable`.

### `view_input.go` a11y read-only clause

Currently:

```go
if cfg.ReadOnly || !cfg.Focusable {
    a11yState = AccessStateReadOnly
}
```

Drop the second clause → `if cfg.ReadOnly`. With focusable-by-default,
non-focusable is now an explicit `FocusDisabled` opt-out, not the historical
proxy for read-only. A missing ID must not announce read-only on a field nobody
marked read-only.

### `requiredid` analyzer (`tools/requiredid/`)

No code change expected: its "Focusable: true without ID" rule keys on the
literal field, which no longer exists on in-scope Cfgs (writing it is a compile
error). Verify the rule is generic (not Cfg-type-named) and that
`gui:"required"` tags on Slider/Combobox/DatePicker/Listbox IDs are retained. An
analyzer test can assert no diagnostic on a fake Cfg with neither field. Note
that it is low value — `tools/requiredid/testdata` defines its own fake widgets,
so it cannot catch regressions against the real `gui` types.

## Migration

Each phase is a single compile break for the field it removes and **must migrate
every construction site of that Cfg in the same commit** (internal factories,
examples, and tests) so `make check && go test ./...` stays green. A phase is
not "widget + its own tests" — it is the widget plus its whole in-repo call
graph.

- `Focusable: true` on an in-scope Cfg → delete the line (now default).
- `Focusable: <expr>` (wrappers/internal factories) → `FocusDisabled: !<expr>`.
- `Focusable: false` on an in-scope Cfg → `FocusDisabled: true` (**zero**
  occurrences in-repo and across all five consumers).
- Out-of-scope widgets: untouched.

### Consumers (breaking, dependency order)

Re-verify per repo before shipping (grep `Focusable: true` on in-scope Cfg
literals):

1. **go-charts** — 1 `InputCfg` site.
2. **go-kite** — `Input` literals.
3. **go-map** — verify no in-scope literals.
4. **go-edit** — builds `EditorCfg`, not `Input`. Expected clean.
5. **go-term** — no `gui.Input(` usage. Expected clean.

## Tests / examples / docs

- Update in-scope example literals: drop `Focusable: true`.
- Unit assertions, split by ID-requiredness (an ID-less required-ID widget
  cannot be constructed — `Slider` calls `RequireID`/panics at
  `view_slider.go:45`):
  - **All in-scope widgets** (with an `ID`, no `FocusDisabled`): **exactly one**
    focus candidate (assert the count via
    `collectFocusCandidates`/`NextFocusable`, to pin against duplicate tab
    stops). With `FocusDisabled: true`: zero.
  - **Optional-ID widgets only** (`Input`, `Select`, `Toggle`, `Switch`): with
    no `ID`, zero candidates (inert, still renders). Not applicable to `Slider`
    (it panics).
- `view_input_test.go`: existing `Focusable: true` literals → remove.
- **Rewrite `TestInputReadOnlyWithoutFocus`** — it currently asserts
  non-focusable ⇒ `AccessStateReadOnly`, which relied on the dropped
  `!cfg.Focusable` clause. New assertions: `ReadOnly` announces
  `AccessStateReadOnly`. `FocusDisabled` alone does **not**.
- Docs: `shape.go` doc comment already documents `Shape.Focusable` (unchanged).
  Update per-Cfg field docs, the widget skill scaffold, README/CHANGELOG, and
  the per-example READMEs of any example app whose literals changed in Phases
  1–2. Add a note that input controls are focusable by default and inert without
  an `ID`. Include a **disambiguation table** for the four now-coexisting flags:

  | Flag                  | Meaning                                                  |
  | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `Shape.Focusable`     | widget participates in the focus system                  |
  | `FocusSkip`           | focusable + click/selection, but excluded from Tab order |
  | `FocusDisabled` (Cfg) | opt out of the default-on focus (in-scope Cfgs)          |
  | `Disabled`            | non-interactive, also excluded from Tab order            |

## Release

Breaking (field removed) → minor bump `v0.36.0`, CHANGELOG entry. Merge to
`main`, tag, then bump siblings per dependency order.

## Execution protocol

Branch `feat/focusable-default-input` off `main`. One commit per phase, **pause
for review after each**. Verification gate before every commit:

```
make check && go test ./... && golangci-lint run ./...
```

Each code phase migrates the **whole in-repo call graph** of the Cfg it changes
(internal factories, examples, tests), or the gate fails to compile — see
[Call-site migration](#call-site-migration-mandatory-same-commit-as-the-field-removal).

- **Phase 0** — create the branch, commit this spec, pause.
- **Phase 1** — `InputCfg` (single-line + multiline): drop `Focusable`, add
  `FocusDisabled`, drop the `!cfg.Focusable` a11y clause. Migrate **all
  `InputCfg` sites** (enumerate via the commands in
  [Call-site migration](#call-site-migration-mandatory-same-commit-as-the-field-removal)):
  internal factories (wrappers via `FocusDisabled: !cfg.Focusable`. Color-picker
  / command-palette / dialog / datagrid drop `Focusable: true`), the 8 example
  files, and tests (including the one-candidate assertion and the
  `TestInputReadOnlyWithoutFocus` rewrite). Gate, commit, pause.
- **Phase 2** — `Select`, `Slider`, `Toggle`, `Switch`: same swap, each with its
  full call graph (factories, examples, tests). Gate, commit, pause.
- **Phase 3** — docs only (per-Cfg field docs, disambiguation table, widget
  skill scaffold, README, per-example READMEs for the example apps touched in
  Phases 1–2), `requiredid` analyzer test, CHANGELOG. Gate, commit, pause.
- **Release** — merge to `main`, tag `v0.36.0`. Then siblings in dependency
  order (go-charts → go-kite → go-map → go-edit → go-term): one commit per repo,
  gated and shipped, pause after each.

No commits without explicit permission at each pause.

## Resolved

- Phase 1 reduced to `Input`. The two Input wrappers (`NumericInput`,
  `InputDate`) join the deferred bucket per the Decision-11 invariant and the
  audit (Findings 1–2 from review).
- Composites deferred. Borderline widgets stay opt-in. Phase 1+2 ship together
  as `v0.36.0`. Analyzer stays silent (Decisions 7–11).
- Review round 3 incorporated: wrappers/internal factories map to
  `FocusDisabled: !cfg.Focusable` (keeps the deferred bug out). Each phase
  migrates its full call graph (not "widget + own tests"). Motivation stats are
  corrected, Phase 2 is reframed as an a11y change, the
  `TestInputReadOnlyWithoutFocus` rewrite is named, and standalone `Radio` is
  explicitly opt-in.
- Review round 4 incorporated: Phase 2 a11y win scoped to ID-bearing sites
  (focus still needs `ID != ""`). The "no ID → zero candidates" test is split by
  ID-requiredness (`Slider` panics without an ID, so it is excluded). Hardcoded
  `InputCfg` counts are replaced with `rg` commands, with the caveat that the
  compiler catches only `Focusable`-bearing literals (docs and omitted-field
  sites need manual review).

## Open questions

None blocking. Verify the exact consumer call-sites at ship time by grepping
`Focusable: true` on in-scope Cfg literals in each repo.
