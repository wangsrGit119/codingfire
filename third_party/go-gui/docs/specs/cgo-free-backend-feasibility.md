# CGo-free desktop backend — feasibility assessment

Assessment of [issue #137](https://github.com/go-gui-org/go-gui/issues/137).
Date: 2026-07-31. Status: **Phase 1 implemented**, and the `gui/audio` follow-up
(§ Audio outcome) closed the remaining Linux CGo dependency. **Phase 2 (macOS)
closed 2026-08-12 by decision: not pursued — macOS stays cgo.** See § Phase 2
for the rationale and the conditions that can reopen it.

## Phase 1 outcome (2026-07-31)

`github.com/go-gl/gl` is gone. It was replaced by `gui/backend/internal/glbind`,
a purego binding for the 55 GL entry points and 45 constants the backend uses.
The binding resolves through the proc-address functions that already existed:
`eglProc` on Linux, and a new `glProc` on Windows that reproduces go-gl's
wglGetProcAddress-then-opengl32 fallback. Call sites changed by import swap
only.

Measured result:

| Target                              | `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build`    |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| windows/amd64, windows/arm64        | `./...` — **entire module** |
| linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/386 | `./gui/backend/...`         |

Two corrections to the assessment below:

- The constant count is **45**, not 47. The original `grep` used `\b(gogl|gl)\.`
  where `go?gl` was intended, so bare `gl.`-qualified references in `backend.go`
  were miscounted.
- **`github.com/go-gl/gl` was not the only CGo dependency on Linux.**
  `gui/audio` pulls in `github.com/ebitengine/oto/v3`, whose Linux driver is cgo
  (`#cgo pkg-config: alsa` in `driver_unix.go`). The original verification
  missed it because `go build` stopped at the go-gl load error. Windows is
  unaffected — oto's Windows driver is pure syscall. Full
  `CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build ./...` therefore still fails, on
  `gui/audio` alone. That is a separate dependency that needs its own decision
  (gate `gui/audio` behind a build tag, or replace oto on Linux). It was left
  out of Phase 1.

32-bit was **not** dropped: purego supports 386/arm via `syscall_32bit.go`, and
`linux/386` builds.

## Audio outcome (2026-08-04)

The `gui/audio` dependency left out of Phase 1 (see the second correction above)
is resolved. [Issue #141](https://github.com/go-gui-org/go-gui/issues/141) put
the output driver behind a 3-function seam — `outputInit` / `outputPlay` /
`outputClose`, split across `output_oto.go` and `output_pulse.go`.

The default Linux sink is now a pure-Go PulseAudio client
(`github.com/jfreymuth/pulse`), so `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...` is green on
Linux for the **entire module**, not just `./gui/backend/...`. oto/ALSA remains
available on Linux, opt-in via `-tags otoaudio`. Windows and macOS still use
oto. beep decode/mix was already pure Go and did not change.

## Why not WebGPU (2026-06 → 2026-07-31)

Recorded here because it is the question this assessment supersedes.

A WebGPU backend was explored on branch `webgpu-backend` (since deleted): 12
WGSL shader pipelines, device init, and the render loop all worked. It was
rejected at the time because WebGPU has no native text rendering. Font
measurement and glyph rasterization required Canvas2D, and a hybrid backend
defeats the purpose. GPU acceleration also does not address this project's
actual bottleneck, which is heap allocation rather than throughput.

By 2026-07 both original blockers were gone: go-glyph gained a pure-Go text
pipeline (`bitmap_puregoft.go` — go-text/typesetting harfbuzz shaping plus
`golang.org/x/image/vector` rasterization, no CGo), and
[goffi](https://github.com/go-webgpu/goffi) supplies zero-CGo FFI for calling
wgpu-native. A CGo-free WebGPU desktop backend became technically viable.

It remains the wrong instrument, for the reasons in §4: wgpu is a superset that
ships 10–40 MB of runtime shared libraries, supplies none of `NativePlatform`
(10 sub-interfaces), and leaves macOS — the only real CGo backend, 5.9k lines of
ObjC — untouched. Phase 1 got CGo-free Linux and Windows for ~600 lines instead.

## Summary

Issue #137 proposes a CGo-free desktop backend built on goffi + wgpu-native +
GLFW, scoped as "roughly a full backend rewrite — 4–8k lines Go + ~12 WGSL
shaders."

Both of the issue's premises hold. Its scoping does not.

Linux and Windows are already CGo-free apart from **one** dependency
(`github.com/go-gl/gl`), whose surface area in this repo is 55 functions and 45
constants — and whose proc-address loader is already written in pure Go. The
wgpu path is a superset of that work, does not address macOS (the only real CGo
backend), and trades a build-time C toolchain for a runtime shared-library
distribution burden.

**Recommendation: close the wgpu/goffi path. Do the 55-function swap instead.**

## 1. The stated blockers are genuinely resolved

The issue is correct on both counts.

**Pure-Go text.** The go-glyph root package has zero `import "C"`.
`bitmap_puregoft.go`, `context_puregoft.go`, `layout_ft.go`, and
`grapheme_ft.go` all build under `//go:build linux || darwin || windows` with no
cgo tag gate — the pure-Go path is the _default_, not an opt-in.
`go-glyph/go.mod` requires only go-text/typesetting, x/image, uniseg, and
x/text. CGo in go-glyph is confined to `backend/gpu/`, `backend/android/`,
`backend/ios/`, and examples.

**Zero-CGo FFI.** goffi is real: 8 desktop targets, crosscall2 C-thread
callbacks, full struct ABI, 88–114 ns/call.

## 2. Linux and Windows are already almost CGo-free

`gui/backend/gl/` contains no `import "C"` in any file. It already uses:

| Concern                | Mechanism                        | File                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| X11 windowing / events | `github.com/jezek/xgb` (pure Go) | `platform_x11.go`                     |
| EGL context creation   | `github.com/ebitengine/purego`   | `egl_linux.go:65`                     |
| Win32 / WGL            | `golang.org/x/sys` syscall       | `platform_win32.go`, `wgl_windows.go` |
| GL dispatch            | **`github.com/go-gl/gl` (cgo)**  | 8 files                               |

The last row is the only CGo dependency. Confirmed by build — both targets fail
with exactly one error, and it is that import:

```
package .../gui/backend
    imports .../gui/backend/gl
    imports github.com/go-gl/gl/v3.3-core/gl: build constraints exclude all Go files
```

Surface area to port: **55 distinct GL functions, 45 constants**. Crucially, the
proc-address plumbing needed to bind them is already written and already pure Go
— `platform_x11.go:287` calls `gl.InitWithProcAddrFunc(eglProc)`, where
`eglProc` comes from a purego-loaded `eglGetProcAddress`. `wgl_windows.go` has
the Windows equivalent.

Phase 1 is therefore a swap of one dispatch layer: roughly 600 lines of purego
bindings. No shader rewrite, no wgpu, no GLFW, no windowing changes.

## 3. macOS is the entire remaining problem

- `gui/backend/metal/` — 7,202 lines total, 9 Go files with `import "C"`, 3,311
  lines of `.m`/`.h`. Across the whole tree (metal, ios, android, filedialog):
  5,924 lines of ObjC/C.
- macOS-only CGo outside the backend: `nativemenu/menu_darwin.go`,
  `filedialog/dialog_darwin.go`, `printdialog/print_darwin.go`,
  `spellcheck/spellcheck_darwin.go`, `sysbeep/sysbeep_darwin.go`,
  `gui/locale_detect_darwin.go`.
- The Linux/Windows counterparts of those services are _already_ pure Go:
  `dialog_linux.go` (396 lines, portal/zenity), `dialog_windows.go` (369 lines,
  syscall), `spellcheck_linux.go` (244 lines), godbus for SNI and AT-SPI.

Nothing about the wgpu proposal touches any of this.

## 4. Why wgpu + goffi is the wrong instrument

**It does not supply native services.** `gui/native_platform.go` defines
`NativePlatform` as 10 sub-interfaces and ~30 methods: dialogs, notifier,
printer, bookmarks, a11y, IME, spellcheck, menubar, system tray, sound, plus
`OpenURI`, `TitlebarDark`, `SetWindowVibrancy`. wgpu-native and GLFW supply none
of it. The issue's claim that "existing pure-Go fallbacks (Android/iOS prove the
pattern)" does not hold. `android/native_platform.go` no-ops only menubar, tray,
and beep. The android/ios backends are themselves cgo (`import "C"` in
`backend.go`, `draw.go`, `text.go`, `textures.go`).

**CGo-free is not dependency-free.** Today's Linux/Windows build bundles no
native library — it dlopens the system's `libEGL`/`libGL`/`opengl32`. A
wgpu-native + GLFW backend replaces a _build-time_ C toolchain requirement with
a _runtime_ obligation to ship and load ~10–40 MB of platform-specific shared
objects. That is a net regression for distribution, not an improvement.

**goffi is pre-1.0.** v0.6.0 is in progress. API stability is planned for
v1.0.0. It also has a documented duplicate-`_cgo_init` symbol conflict with
purego, which go-gui already depends on (`go.mod`:
`github.com/ebitengine/purego v0.10.1`). Adopting goffi forces `-tags nofakecgo`
on every downstream consumer.

**The cost is strictly larger.** 12 WGSL shaders, device/surface init, and
windowing glue, on top of the same GL-dispatch problem — and macOS still
unsolved at the end of it.

## 5. Recommended path

### Phase 1 — Linux + Windows CGo-free (high value, low risk)

Replace `github.com/go-gl/gl/v3.3-core/gl` with an internal purego-backed GL
binding.

- New package `gui/backend/internal/glbind/`: 55 function pointers plus the 45
  referenced constants, bound through the existing proc-address callbacks.
- Reuse the `purego.Dlopen` / `purego.RegisterLibFunc` pattern already in
  `gui/backend/gl/egl_linux.go`, and the existing `eglProc` / WGL proc lookups.
  Do not introduce a second loader.
- Touch points: the 8 files importing `go-gl/gl` (`backend.go`, `draw.go`,
  `pipeline.go`, `buffers.go`, `textures.go`, `text.go`, `platform_x11.go`,
  `platform_win32.go`). Import swap only — call sites keep their signatures.
- Watch items:
  - `gogl.Strs` returns a free func. Reimplement it as a null-terminated
    byte-slice helper.
  - `VertexAttribPointerWithOffset` — offset marshaling.
  - `GetShaderiv` / `GetShaderInfoLog` / `GetProgramiv` / `GetProgramInfoLog`
    out-params need explicit pointer marshaling under purego.
- Outcome: `CGO_ENABLED=0` cross-compilation to Linux and Windows from any host.

### Phase 2 — macOS: decided 2026-08-12, not pursued

~~Evaluate `github.com/ebitengine/purego/objc` for hosting an `NSView` /
`CAMetalLayer` subclass with delegate callbacks via `objc_msgSend` and runtime
class registration. Gate the decision on two questions:~~

1. ~~Does purego work under `CGO_ENABLED=0` on darwin/arm64 for the
   _class-registration_ path, not just plain function calls?~~
2. ~~Can the ObjC be ported service-by-service, or does the NSApplication/NSView
   delegate graph force an all-or-nothing rewrite?~~

~~If either answer is bad, macOS stays cgo. That is an acceptable outcome: macOS
is the one platform where a C toolchain (Xcode CLT) is universally present
anyway.~~

**Decision: macOS keeps cgo. Do not reopen without a concrete trigger.**

The value of a cgo-free build is build-time portability: `CGO_ENABLED=0`
cross-compiles from any host, no clang/SDK install for consumers, smaller CI.
Every one of those is weakest on macOS:

- Cross-compiling a macOS GUI binary from another host is hollow: a GUI app must
  be run and signed/notarized on a Mac anyway.
- Xcode CLT is universally present on macOS. There is no toolchain-friction
  story to fix for consumers.
- The spike's hard part was never the call ABI but ObjC the language:
  subclassing `NSView`/`CAMetalLayer` needs runtime class registration (the
  shaky zone of `purego/objc`) and hand-managed retain/release and autorelease
  pools where clang does it for free today. High bug surface, no user-visible
  payoff.
- The macOS-only CGo outside the backend (`nativemenu/menu_darwin.go`,
  `filedialog/dialog_darwin.go`, `printdialog/print_darwin.go`,
  `spellcheck/spellcheck_darwin.go`, `sysbeep/sysbeep_darwin.go`,
  `gui/locale_detect_darwin.go`) each needs a port that is strictly worse than
  its Linux/syscall counterpart.

The Linux/Windows phase earned its keep because those hosts lack a guaranteed
toolchain. The macOS phase inverts the argument. The issue
(go-gui-org/go-gui#137) was closed when Phase 1 shipped and stays closed.

Reopening conditions (any one, evidenced, not speculative):

- Apple stops shipping a C toolchain with macOS / Xcode CLT becomes optional.
- A consumer reports a real build blocker caused by the ObjC cgo (not a
  hypothetical), and `purego/objc` class registration is proven working at
  `CGO_ENABLED=0` on darwin/arm64.
- A one-shot proof that the `NSView`/`CAMetalLayer` subclass graph ports
  service-by-service rather than all-or-nothing, with the retain/release
  management plan written down.

### Out of scope

wgpu-native, GLFW/SDL2, WGSL shaders, goffi.

## Verification

Every number above is reproducible:

```fish
# 1. go-glyph root package has no cgo
cd ~/Documents/github/go-glyph; grep -rl 'import "C"' --include='*.go' .

# 2. gl backend has no cgo; one dependency blocks CGO_ENABLED=0
cd ~/Documents/github/go-gui
grep -rl 'import "C"' --include='*.go' gui/backend/gl/   # empty
env CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -tags gl ./gui/...
env CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=windows go build ./gui/...

# 3. GL surface area to port (55 functions, 45 constants)
# Historical: run before Phase 1, when gui/backend/gl/ still imported go-gl.
# The regex is go?gl\. — the original used \b(gogl|gl)\. and over-counted
# constants as 47; see the correction under "Phase 1 outcome" above.
grep -rhoE '\bgo?gl\.[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9_]*\(' gui/backend/gl/ --include='*.go' | sort -u | wc -l
grep -rhoE '\bgo?gl\.[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]+\b'    gui/backend/gl/ --include='*.go' | sort -u | wc -l

# 4. macOS native surface
grep -rl 'import "C"' --include='*.go' gui/backend/metal/ | wc -l   # 9
find gui -name '*.m' -o -name '*.h' | xargs wc -l | tail -1         # 5924
```

Acceptance test if Phase 1 is approved: both `CGO_ENABLED=0` builds above
succeed. `go test ./gui/...` passes, and `go run ./examples/get_started/` on
Linux renders unchanged.
