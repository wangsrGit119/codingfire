# Developer ergonomics: assessment and improvement plan

Status: **implemented** — every row of the §6.1 progress table is done: phase 1
shipped v0.53.0, the §4.3 callback/event collapse v0.55.0, the §4.4/§4.5 color
and padding work across v0.56–v0.59, and §4.8's example audit closed. All of §9
Q1–Q8 resolved, including the Q6 nested-scroll gate
(`gui/scroll_nested_test.go`). The §4.7 renames are part of that. The release
plan below is historical, not pending. Base: `main` @ `80715d1`. Phase progress:
§6.1.

## Context

Two independent reviews rated app-level ergonomics ~7/10. Both landed on the
same shape of problem: the immediate-mode core is sound, and the friction is
bookkeeping the framework pushes onto callers (IDs, state keys, event flags,
per-widget colors). This spec records what was measured, corrects two claims
that do not hold against the code, and prioritizes fixes.

Scope is API surface only. The rendering pipeline, allocation profile, and
immediate-mode model are not in question.

## 1. What was measured

All counts taken from `main` @ `80715d1`. Counting rules in §10 — several
figures depend on dedupe and scope choices.

| Metric                                 | Count | Source                              |

| `On*` callback decls, raw              | 136   | `ergonomics-audit -mode callbacks`  |

| Examples calling `WindowSize()`        | 45    | 50 sites, 108 arithmetic lines      |

## 2. What works

Not a preamble — these are the constraints any fix must preserve.

- **Small core.** `NewWindow(WindowCfg)`, a view function, `gui.State[T](w)`,
  `backend.Run(w)`. `examples/get_started/main.go` is a stateful app in 60 lines
  including comments.
- **Zero-value `Cfg` structs.** Uniform across all ~50 factories. Adding a field
  is non-breaking, and autocomplete on `gui.ButtonCfg{` is the documentation.
- **No closures over state, no globals.** One typed state slot per window kills
  the entire stale-closure bug class.
- **Composition is plain functions.** `cardView(w)`, `listView(w)` in
  `examples/todo/main.go` — no registration, no interface to implement.

## 3. Corrections to circulating claims

Recorded because both errors served as justification for work.

### 3.1 "Callback signatures are consistent `func(EventCtx)`" — false

Only 16 of 70 distinct signatures use the bare form. `InputCfg` alone carries
two conventions on adjacent fields (`gui/view_input.go:24,29`):

```go
OnTextChanged func(string, EventCtx)
OnTextCommit  func(*Layout, string, InputCommitReason, *Window)
```

Six callbacks still leak a raw `*Event` (§10 — two are the qualified `*gg.Event`
in `datagrid`, which an unqualified grep misses), including
`SplitterCfg.OnChange func(float32, SplitterCollapsed, *Event, *Window)`
(`gui/view_splitter.go:125`). The v0.52 `EventCtx` refactor
(`docs/specs/eventctx-callback-refactor.md`) converted the consume-class events
and stopped.

### 3.2 "`StateMap` plumbing leaks into app code" — false

Zero `StateMap` references exist in `examples/`. `nsSelect` and `capModerate`
are unexported (`gui/layout_overflow.go:65`), so app code cannot write that
call. The encapsulation being asked for already exists. The reviewer read an
internal file as public surface. **No work required.**

## 4. Proposals, prioritized

### 4.1 Debug gate — additive, do first

`GOGUI_FOCUS_DEBUG` (`gui/layout_query.go:10`) already establishes the pattern
for exactly one check. Generalize it into a single `gui.Debug` gate covering:

- duplicate `ID` in one frame (not only focusable ones)
- any shape with `Focusable == true && ID == ""` (see §4.2)
- any shape with `Scrollable == true && ID == ""` (see §4.9)
- `State[T]` type mismatch, with the concrete type held vs requested

Deliberately **not** in v1 of the gate: "consume-class event reaching dispatch
with no handler". Every inert shape under the cursor trips it, so it is noise
before it is signal. Revisit scoped to shapes that are focusable or that claim a
consume-class handler.

`focusDebug` is a package-level `os.Getenv` read (`gui/layout_query.go:10`), so
the honest claim is **no-op unless enabled**, not "compiles to nothing" — there
is no build tag and no dead-code elimination. If zero-cost-when-off matters,
that is a separate `//go:build` decision, not something the current pattern
delivers.

To be precise about the cost, since it was queried:
`var focusDebug = os.Getenv(...)` is evaluated **once** at package var-init.
There is no per-frame `os.Getenv` today, and the guarded read in `focusDupWarn`
(`gui/layout_query.go:14`) is a plain bool load.

**But make the flag `atomic.Bool`.** The proposal here is `gui.Debug(b)` — a
function, so the flag becomes _mutable_, which today's env-only value is not.
`focusDupWarn` is called from focus-candidate collection
(`gui/layout_query.go:109`), that is, per candidate per frame, so a plain bool
read racing a `Debug(true)` write from another goroutine is a data race that
`-race` will flag. `atomic.Bool.Load` compiles to a plain load on amd64 and
arm64, so this costs nothing measurable. The mutability, not the lookup, is the
reason.

**Warn once per `(check, ID)` per window.** These checks run at focus-candidate
collection — per candidate, per frame — so an undeduplicated warning for one
ID-less button is emitted at the frame rate. That is not a diagnostic, it is a
reason to turn the gate back off, which defeats the item. Dedup state resets on
window close and on a `false → true` transition of `Debug`, so re-enabling the
gate after fixing something reports the current state rather than staying
silent. The ID-less checks key on the shape's position in the tree, since `""`
is precisely what they are reporting.

No API breakage. This converts the current "works but subtly doesn't" bugs into
immediate errors and is the cheapest item on the list.

### 4.2 Close the focus/ID hole, and delete `RequireFocusID`

`isFocusedTarget` (`gui/event_traversal.go:17`) returns `false` on an empty ID,
so a focusable widget without an `ID` renders, clicks, and silently never joins
the tab order.

**There are two separate holes, and the uncovered one is larger.** Widget `Cfg`
types split into two focus conventions:

| Group             | Field                | Cfg types | Analyzer |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | --------- | -------- |
| Opt-in            | `Focusable bool`     | 12        | covers   |
| Focusable-by-dflt | `FocusDisabled bool` | 15        | **none** |

("Cfg types" is exact: the `Focusable bool` inventory also matches `Shape`,
`termgrid`, and `inspector`, which are not app-facing `Cfg`s and are excluded
from the 12.)

The analyzer's `checkFocusableID` keys on a literal `Focusable` field
(`tools/requiredid/requiredid.go:91`). Focusable-by-default `Cfg`s never set one
— their own testdata records this as intended: "Focusable-by- default Cfgs never
set Focusable, so the rule stays quiet"
(`tools/requiredid/testdata/src/widgets/widgets.go:117`).

So the second group is unguarded end to end. `gui/view_button.go:135` resolves
`Focusable: !cfg.FocusDisabled` — true by default — and passes `ID: cfg.ID`
through unvalidated, with no `RequireID` call. And **9 of the 15** default-on
`Cfg`s carry no `gui:"required"` tag on `ID`: `Button`, `Input`, `NumericInput`,
`InputDate`, `Radio`, `RadioButtonGroup`, `Select`, `Switch`, `Toggle`. Six do
have it: `Combobox`, `ColorPicker`, `DatePicker`, `ListBox`, `Slider`, `Tree`.

Concretely, today:

```go
gui.Button(gui.ButtonCfg{OnClick: handler}) // compiles, vets clean,
                                            // renders, clicks —
                                            // never tab-reachable
```

That is the most-used widget in the library, failing silently, caught by
nothing. `examples/get_started/main.go:47` sets `ID: "gs_counter"`, but by
convention, not by any enforcement.

**Delete `RequireFocusID` (`gui/state_registry.go:134`).** It is called by
nothing — zero call sites in go-gui (tests included) and zero across all five
sibling repos. Fourteen files expose a `Focusable bool` field and not one of
them invokes it. It is a widget-authoring guard, not app-facing surface, and
every widget in go-gui is first-party, so it has no external caller by
construction. Removing it is preferable to wiring it up:

- The `requiredid` analyzer (`tools/requiredid/requiredid.go:87`) already
  reports the static case, at build time rather than at first render, with a
  message naming the `Cfg` type.
- `RequireFocusID` is redundant _with the analyzer_, at a strictly worse moment.
  It is not a claim that panics are the wrong tool here — see the enforcement
  split below.
- Retaining a dead exported guard implies a check that does not run. That is
  worse than no guard: it reads like coverage.

**Enforcement split (resolves the apparent panic contradiction).** Deleting one
panic while phase 4 adds `RequireID` to `Button` looks inconsistent. It is not,
once the cases are separated by _when the defect is knowable_:

| Case                              | Knowable at | Mechanism        |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Literal `Cfg{}`, `ID` absent/`""` | compile     | `gui:"required"` |
| `ID: expr` that evaluates to `""` | first call  | `RequireID`      |
| `Focusable` set dynamically       | render      | debug gate       |

`gui:"required"` catches the overwhelming majority statically — that is where
the 126 affected sites live. `RequireID` is the narrow runtime backstop for a
computed ID that turns out empty, which no analyzer can see. The debug gate
covers what neither can. `RequireFocusID` fits none of these rows: its static
case is already the analyzer's, and its dynamic case is `RequireID`'s.

**Row 1 is compile-time only where the analyzer runs, which today is this repo
alone.** `gui:"required"` is an ordinary struct tag. No compiler, no `go build`,
and no plain `go vet` reads it. Only `requiredid` does, and `requiredid` is a
standalone binary invoked explicitly (`Makefile:104`,
`.github/workflows/ci.yml:155`). Importing go-gui does not run it. For an app
author who wires up nothing, the tag is inert and row 1 collapses into row 2:

| Case                              | go-gui gets     | Author gets, unwired |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Literal `Cfg{}`, `ID` absent/`""` | analyzer, in CI | `RequireID` panic    |
| `ID: expr` that evaluates to `""` | `RequireID`     | `RequireID`          |
| `Focusable` set dynamically       | debug gate      | debug gate, if on    |

Consumers are not unprotected — `RequireID` genuinely panics
(`gui/state_registry.go:125-129`), and phase 4 wires it into all 9 default-on
factories, so a missing ID is loud on first render rather than silent. But it is
a runtime panic in a GUI app instead of a build failure, which is the trade this
section argues against everywhere else. Stating it plainly matters because the 3
sibling sites and every future consumer sit in the right-hand column, not the
left.

Adoption is one line, which is what makes leaving it undocumented wasteful.
`requiredid.Analyzer` is exported (`tools/requiredid/requiredid.go:27`),
`tools/` is in the main module rather than a separate one, `cmd/requiredid` is a
`singlechecker`, and `golang.org/x/tools` is already a direct dependency
(`go.mod:19`):

```fish
go run github.com/go-gui-org/go-gui/tools/requiredid/cmd/requiredid ./...
```

A `go tool` directive, `go vet -vettool=`, or a golangci-lint custom plugin all
work equally. §8 carries the doc deliverable. Whether the analyzer becomes
_supported_ surface rather than an internal tool is Q8 (§9), and it is the one
question this spec does not resolve.

**Route the residual gap to the debug gate.** The analyzer is static, so three
cases stay dark. They belong in §4.1, not in a panic:

| Case                                     | Analyzer | Debug gate |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| `FocusCfg{Focusable: true}`              | reports  | —          |
| `FocusCfg{Focusable: on}` (dynamic flag) | silent   | catches    |
| `FocusCfg{ID: id}` where `id == ""`      | silent   | catches    |
| `//requiredid:ignore` opt-out            | silent   | catches    |

Add one `gui.Debug` check: at focus-candidate collection, warn on any shape with
`Focusable == true && ID == ""`. It inspects `Shape`, not `Cfg`, so it covers
**both** groups above — including the 15 default-on widgets the analyzer cannot
see at all. This is the immediate mitigation and the reason phase 1 matters more
than its size suggests.

**Fix only the unguarded group. `ID` stays the single identity key.** The two
holes are not symmetric, and treating them as one problem is what made earlier
drafts of this section long:

| Group           | Guarded today            | Live defects | Fix                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Opt-in (12)     | yes — `checkFocusableID` | **0**        | none                |
| Default-on (15) | **no**                   | **126**      | tag 9 + `RequireID` |

So the whole fix is the default-on row: tag `ID` with `gui:"required"` on the 9
that lack it, add `RequireID` to their factories. Focus stays default-on. The ID
that focus depends on becomes mandatory. That is phase 1, non-breaking, and it
closes **every defect the audit found**.

**An earlier draft also proposed collapsing the opt-in group's
`Focusable bool` + `ID` pair into `Focus: gui.Focus(id)` — a constructed value
whose only constructor takes an ID, making the invalid state unrepresentable.
That is cut.** It is a real improvement in the abstract and the wrong trade
here:

- The opt-in group is **already covered**. `checkFocusableID`
  (`tools/requiredid/requiredid.go:87-106`) reports `Focusable: true` without a
  non-empty ID today. The audit found 126 broken literals and **all of them are
  default-on** — the opt-in group has zero, because the analyzer catches them.
  The collapse converts an error that is already caught into one that cannot be
  written: real, marginal.
- It costs a breaking change, 11 sibling edits to code that is correct as
  written today, and the entire complication below.
- **It erodes the property that makes IDs worth having.** `ID` is one
  deterministic identity key: 242 `StateMap[string, …]` sites and §4.9's scroll
  offsets all key off `Shape.ID`. A `Focus` value that also carries an ID is a
  second way to write the same key. `ContainerCfg` is the only type that is both
  opt-in-focusable and scrollable (`Focusable` :97, `Scrollable` :102, `ID`
  :67), so it carries `Focus: gui.Focus("panel")` for focus _and_ `ID: "panel"`
  for scroll keying, with nothing forcing them to agree:

```go
// Would have needed a new rule to forbid: which one keys the scroll?
gui.ContainerCfg{Focus: gui.Focus("a"), ID: "b", Scrollable: true}
```

That state does not exist today. Closing a hole that the analyzer already
covers, by introducing a defect class that does not yet exist, is the wrong
direction — and the mutual-exclusion rule, its analyzer check, and its debug
check all existed only to contain a problem the change itself created.

**What is genuinely given up.** In a repo that does not run the analyzer,
`Focusable: true` without an ID stays silently inert. That is bounded from both
sides: the §4.1 debug gate catches it at render time regardless of analyzer
adoption, and Q8 (§9) already governs whether the analyzer is something
consumers are expected to run. It is the same gap Q8 exists to decide, not a new
one.

Revisit only if the opt-in group starts accumulating real defects, or if a
widget needs to move between the two groups.

**Follow-up: three interactive widgets are in the wrong group.** The split above
reads cleanly — input controls default on, display and container elements opt in
— with three exceptions:

| Cfg              | Group  | Ships keyboard nav                                            |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TabControlCfg`  | opt-in | `KeyLeft/Up`, `KeyRight/Down` (`view_tab_control.go:447,453`) |
| `BreadcrumbCfg`  | opt-in | `KeyLeft`, `KeyRight` (`view_breadcrumb.go:294,300`)          |
| `ThemePickerCfg` | opt-in | `OnKeyDown` (`view_theme_picker.go:114`)                      |

All three are controls a user expects to tab into, and all three **already
implement arrow-key navigation**. That handler is dead code unless the author
sets both `Focusable: true` and an `ID` — so the library ships keyboard support
that is off by default, for widgets whose whole purpose is interaction.

This is a different defect class from the 126 and is why the audit does not
count it: nothing here is written incorrectly. `Focusable` unset is a valid
state that the analyzer cannot flag, because for `Container` and `Text` it is
the right default. The gap is in the default itself, not in any call site.

Measured: of 18 literals of these three `Cfg`s outside their own factories, **3
set `Focusable: true`**. The other 15 render a control with working key handling
that no keyboard user can reach.

Proposed, as a follow-up rather than part of phase 1: move the three to the
default-on group — replace `Focusable bool` with `FocusDisabled bool`, tag `ID`
with `gui:"required"`, wire `RequireID`. It is breaking in the same shape as the
flat-color removal, so it rides phase 4 if taken. Deliberately **not** folded
into phase 1: phase 1 is scoped to defects that exist against the current
design, and this is a change _to_ the design. Deciding it needs a look at the
remaining nine opt-in members (`Splitter`, `OverflowPanel`, `DatePickerRoller`,
and `TermGrid` are the next-closest calls) rather than these three in isolation.

**Measured migration cost.** All 408 literals of the 9 unguarded `Cfg` types
across go-gui and the five siblings, counted with a `go/ast` walker (regex
cannot bracket-match multi-line literals):

| Location           | withID | noID + opt-out | noID (affected) |
| ------------------ | ------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| go-gui tests       | —      | —              | 66              |
| go-gui examples    | —      | —              | 45              |
| **go-gui library** | —      | —              | **12**          |
| go-charts          | 8      | 0              | 1               |
| go-map             | 1      | 0              | 2               |
| go-edit/kite/term  | 6      | 0              | 0               |
| **Total**          | 281    | **1**          | **126**         |

Three conclusions:

1. **Consumer cost is 3 sites**, all in example programs
   (`go-charts/examples/basic_line/main.go:86`,
   `go-map/examples/full-map/main.go:126,139`). Application code in go-edit,
   go-kite, and go-term already supplies IDs throughout.
2. **12 affected sites are go-gui's own widgets** — the toast action and dismiss
   buttons (`gui/view_toast.go:170,179`), the date-picker month toggle and
   prev/next arrows (`gui/view_date_picker.go:269, 278,288`), plus
   `view_date_picker_calendar.go:100`, `view_input_date.go:121`,
   `view_markdown_blocks.go:166`, `view_overflow_panel.go:60`,
   `time_travel_view.go:274`, and two in `gui/datagrid/`. Each carries an
   `OnClick` and none is keyboard-reachable. These are live accessibility
   defects in shipped first-party widgets, and requiring `ID` is what surfaces
   them.
3. **The decorative-button case is theoretical.** Exactly 1 literal of 408 uses
   `FocusDisabled` as an opt-out. Migration is "add an ID", not "audit every
   button for intent".

The change is therefore a bug-finder that costs three example-file edits in
repos you own — not a migration tax.

**Pull the go-gui-internal half into phase 1.** The 12 library defects and the 9
missing `gui:"required"` tags need no API change — adding an `ID` to
`gui/view_toast.go:170` is an ordinary bug fix, and tagging the 9 `Cfg`s only
breaks callers _inside_ this repo, which `requiredid` flags in CI. Doing both in
phase 1 closes the live accessibility bugs immediately and turns the analyzer
into a working gate. Phase 1 as originally written only _warns_ about these
defects. There is no reason to wait to fix them.

With the opt-in collapse cut, **§4.2 is entirely phase 1** and contains no
breaking change at all. Nothing here waits for the §4.3 release.

(Both claims were wrong: §4.2 wires `RequireID` into nine factories, which is a
runtime break. See the correction in §6.)

### 4.3 One combined breaking release: events + callbacks

Two changes, one migration, because every one costs the five sibling repos
(`go-charts`, `go-edit`, `go-kite`, `go-term`, `go-map`) a bump.

**Finish `EventCtx` — for event-driven callbacks only.** Convert the
`*Window`-tailed and `*Event`-leaking callbacks that actually fire from an input
event. Target for that set: two shapes — `func(EventCtx)` and
`func(T, EventCtx)` — with no `*Layout` or `*Event` parameter.

**Explicitly out of scope: 14 of the 27 distinct `*Window`-tail signatures.**
Twelve fire from a timer tick, a dialog completion, or a lifecycle transition —
`OnInit`, `OnCloseRequest`, `OnCancelNo`, `OnOkYes`, `OnDismiss`, `OnReply`,
`OnLazyLoad`, `OnValue`, and four `OnDone` variants. **There is no event.**
Giving them an `EventCtx` means a permanently-nil `ctx.Event` — the wart
`CLAUDE.md` already documents for `AmendLayout` and `OnScroll`, multiplied by
twelve.

Two more are not callbacks at all but view builders that return a value:
`OnCellFormat func(…) GridCellFormat` and `OnDetailRowView func(…) gg.View`.
They are misnamed rather than mis-signatured. Renaming them out of the `On*`
space reads clearer than converting them.

That leaves **13 genuinely event-driven** signatures to convert: `OnAction`,
`OnChange`, `OnLayoutChange`, `OnPanelClose`, `OnPanelSelect`, both `OnReorder`
variants, `OnReset`, `OnSelect`, `OnSubmit`, `OnTextCommit`, `OnToggle`,
`OnValueCommit`.

`WindowCfg.OnEvent` / `Window.OnEvent` (`gui/window_cfg.go:14`,
`gui/window.go:168`, the same field declared twice) is a raw escape hatch by
design and also stays `func(*Event, *Window)`.

See §7.1 for how the boundary was measured.

**Collapse the event model to one rule.** The consume-class / notify-class split
plus `ctx.Bubble()` as an escape hatch is the most confusing part of the API.
Adopt: every callback starts unhandled. Call `ctx.Consume()` to stop
propagation. Delete `Bubble()` and the auto-handled class. Cost is real — 23
`Bubble()`/`Consume()` sites in `examples/` alone plus all sibling call sites —
which is precisely why it bundles with the signature work rather than shipping
separately.

#### 4.3.1 Pre-implementation verification (2026-08-08)

Phase 4 is the first breaking phase, so every concrete claim in §4.3 and §4.7
was re-verified against the tree before any code was written. What follows is
the result, not a plan.

**Verified exactly, no change needed:** the 12 out-of-scope lifecycle signatures
including all four `OnDone` variants. `OnCellFormat` returning `GridCellFormat`
and `OnDetailRowView` returning `gg.View`, both confined to `gui/datagrid/`.
Zero sibling references to either. `RTF(cfg RtfCfg)` at `gui/view_rtf.go:212`.
Zero sibling references to `RtfCfg` or `gui.RTF`. `OnEvent` declared twice as
`func(*Event, *Window)`. And the 8 `Color*` sibling sites, all in go-charts. The
`27` distinct `func(T..., *Window)` signatures reproduce from
`ergonomics-audit`.

**Three event-driven callbacks appear in neither list.** §4.3 partitions 27
signatures into 14 out-of-scope and 13 to convert. Scanning `gui/datagrid/` as
well — it uses `*gg.Window`, which the §4.3 sweep did not match — surfaces three
more:

- `OnItemClick func(string, int, *Event, *Window)` — 2 call sites.
- `OnColumnPinChange func(string, GridColumnPin, *gg.Event, *gg.Window)`
- `OnCopyRows func([]GridRow, *gg.Event, *gg.Window) (string, bool)`

The first two carry a raw `*Event` and convert cleanly. **`OnCopyRows` does not
fit the target at all**: it returns `(string, bool)`, and both target shapes —
`func(EventCtx)` and `func(T, EventCtx)` — return nothing. §4.3 found two
value-returning callbacks and disposed of them by renaming out of the `On*`
space, but that remedy does not apply here: `OnCopyRows` is genuinely
event-driven, so it needs either a third target shape or an explicit exemption.
This is the one gap that changes the design rather than the count.

**`OnReorder` has one signature, not two.** "Both `OnReorder` variants"
describes four declaration sites of an identical type. Conversely `OnChange` and
`OnSelect` each have two genuinely distinct signatures that the list counts once
apiece.

**The `Bubble()`/`Consume()` figure is wrong, and understates the real cost by
an order of magnitude.** `examples/` contains 19 `Consume()` calls and **zero**
`Bubble()` calls, not 23 combined. All 26 non-test `Bubble()` sites are inside
go-gui itself (`gui/` 15, `gui/datagrid/` 6, `tools/eventctx` 5), plus 7 in
siblings (go-edit 5, go-term 2).

But counting `Bubble()`/`Consume()` measures the wrong thing. Under the
collapse, `Consume()` keeps working unchanged. What changes is every
**consume-class callback that relies on auto-handling** — those stop being
handled by default and begin propagating to ancestors. `examples/` has **138**
such sites (137 `OnClick`, 1 `OnGesture`). Most sit on widgets with no clickable
ancestor and will be unaffected, but which ones those are is not determinable
without verifying nesting at each. That is the §7.2 silent class, at 138 sites
rather than 23.

**No sibling pays for the signature conversion.** Zero sibling call sites touch
the 13-item convert set. After the tool fixes below, the five repos hold **25**
`*Window`-tailed literals in go-gui-declared fields, and every one is `OnInit`
(13), `OnDone` (9) or `OnValue` (3) — all in the out-of-scope 12.

| Repo      | go-gui fields             | Declared by the sibling |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| go-charts | 9 (OnDone/OnInit/OnValue) | 0                       |
| go-edit   | 8 (OnDone/OnInit)         | 3 (`OnFileDrop`)        |
| go-kite   | 1 (OnInit)                | 0                       |
| go-term   | 1 (OnInit)                | 0                       |
| go-map    | 6 (OnInit)                | 29 (`InfoWindowAction`) |

Reaching those numbers required fixing three bugs in
`ergonomics-audit -mode callbacks`, each of which had produced a claim in this
spec:

1. **Call sites were not attributed to a declaring package.** Any
   `OnX: func(..., *Window)` literal counted, so go-map's own
   `mapview.InfoWindowAction.OnClick` and go-edit's own `OnFileDrop` were
   reported as go-gui migration work. The tool now resolves the literal's type
   through the file's imports and reports the two groups separately. Nested
   literals that elide their type (`[]T{{...}}`, exactly go-map's shape) inherit
   the element type.
2. **Distinct signatures were deduplicated on printed source**, so
   `func(movedID, beforeID string, w *Window)` and
   `func(string, string, *Window)` counted as two. That is the origin of "both
   `OnReorder` variants". Dedup is now by type, ignoring parameter names.
3. **Classification ignored results**, so the value-returning callbacks were
   bucketed by their parameters — `OnCellFormat` and `OnDetailRowView` as
   ordinary `*Window`-tailed, `OnCopyRows` as ordinary `*Event`-leaking. The
   audit therefore missed the one category that fits no target shape. There is
   now a `returns a value` bucket, and it holds exactly those three.

Corrected declaration figures for `./gui`: **69** distinct signatures (was 70),
`func(T..., *Window)` **24** (was 27), `leaks raw *Event` **5** (was 6),
`returns a value` **3** (new). The §4.3 partition restates against these.

So the sibling cost of phase 4 is **not** "every change costs five repos a
bump". It is: 8 `Color*` sites in go-charts, 7 `Bubble()` deletions in go-edit
and go-term, and whatever silent exposure the model collapse creates in their
consume-class handlers — which their 71 combined `Consume()` sites suggest is
the part worth measuring properly before starting.

#### 4.3.2 Conversion as implemented (2026-08-08)

17 distinct signatures converted, against the 13 §4.3 listed: the three
`gui/datagrid/` callbacks §4.3.1 surfaced, plus `OnChange` and `OnSelect` each
contributing a second distinct signature the original count folded into one. The
13 that stayed are exactly the 12 lifecycle signatures plus `OnEvent`.

**`OnCopyRows` took the invariant, not an exemption.** The rule adopted is that
`EventCtx` replaces the `*Layout`, `*Event` and `*Window` parameters and says
nothing about results, so it is now `func([]GridRow, EventCtx) (string, bool)`.
No third target shape and no carve-out — the two target shapes in §4.3 were
stated too narrowly, since "returns nothing" was never load-bearing.

Verified by re-running `ergonomics-audit -mode callbacks`: `func(T..., *Window)`
24 → **12**, `leaks raw *Event` 5 → **1** (`OnEvent` alone), `func(EventCtx)` 16
→ **18**, `func(T..., EventCtx)` 19 → **32**.

**The codemod needed a name filter to be safe at all.** The v0.52 tool matched
by signature, which works only because nothing else in the codebase looks like
`func(*Layout, *Event, *Window)`. A trailing `*Window` is not distinctive — it
describes most internal plumbing — so the widened matcher is gated on an
explicit list of field names (`-fields`), matched ignoring the leading case so
the internal spelling `onSelect` matches the field `OnSelect`.

Three defects surfaced only by running it against the tree, each a case where
the name filter was consulted in the wrong place:

1. **Nested closures inherited the owner name**, converting every
   `w.QueueCommand(func(w *gui.Window) {…})` written inside a converted
   callback. Harmless in the old signature-driven mode, where the owner only
   tinted the consume-class report. Fatal once the owner is the gate.
2. **Named declarations were filtered by their own name.** A function reaches
   the declaration pass only because the plan established it is wired to an
   included field, but the filter then tested `onShowcaseSplitterMainChange`
   against the field list and rejected it.
3. **Assignment targets were read only from selectors**, so
   `onChange := func(…)` — the spelling widget internals and tests actually use
   — was invisible.

All three are pinned by tests in `tools/eventctx/general_test.go`.

**Dispatch now passes the real context through.** Where a widget invokes one of
these callbacks from inside an already-converted callback, the fold emits `ctx`
rather than `EventCtx{nil, ctx.Event, ctx.Window}` — 29 sites. The old signature
carried no `*Layout`, so this hands callers strictly more than before.
Synthesizing a nil layout when one is in scope manufactures an absence. Where no
layout genuinely exists (six internal helpers that only ever had a `*Window`),
`EventCtx{nil, nil, w}` is emitted and is faithful.

Cost: 45 files, zero rule-4 review items, and **zero sibling sites** — verifying
§4.3.1's finding that no sibling pays for this conversion.

#### 4.3.3 Measuring the §4.3b collapse (2026-08-08)

§7.2 says the collapse's risk is silent, and §4.3.1 put the exposure at 138
consume-class sites in `examples/` — while noting that "most sit on widgets with
no clickable ancestor, but which ones those are is not determinable" from the
source. That is the whole difficulty: the question is about the layout tree at
dispatch time, so no amount of grepping answers it.

**So it is now answered at dispatch time.** `gui.Debug(true)` gained a check
(`gui/debug_event.go`) that runs after every consume-class callback and reports
the site when both halves of the hazard hold: the callback relied on the
pre-mark (it neither called `ctx.Consume()` nor `ctx.Bubble()`), **and** an
ancestor also receives the event. Ancestor is decided by replaying that event's
real dispatch condition — `PointInShape` plus the `ClickButton` filter for
`OnClick`, the centroid for `OnGesture`, focus for `OnChar` — so the answer is
the one dispatch actually gives.

`(*Window).TestEventCollapse` sweeps a rendered window with the check armed: it
fires one synthetic event per consume-class callback in the tree and returns the
findings. It presses every button in the window, so it belongs on a throwaway
window.

**Measured exposure: 18 sites, not 138.** Sweeping 37 of the 59 examples (the
rest build their state inside `main()`, so a generated sweep cannot construct
them):

| Example               | Findings |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| `color_picker`        | 8        |
| `dock_layout`         | 4        |
| `date_picker_options` | 1        |
| `key_up_demo`         | 1        |
| `menu_demo`           | 1        |
| `multiline_input`     | 1        |
| `showcase`            | 1        |
| `todo`                | 1        |

**The important part is not the count but the owner.** Read the pairs:
`"dock_close:editor"` inside `"dock_tab:top:editor"`, `"picker.rgb.0"` inside
the color picker's row, a text input inside its clickable container. Both sides
of nearly every pair are go-gui's own widget internals — `view_color_picker.go`,
`dock_layout.go`, `view_input.go` — not application code. The collapse's silent
cost is therefore mostly go-gui's to pay, in a handful of files, and
mechanically: add `ctx.Consume()` to the inner handler and its behavior is
pinned before the model changes at all.

(The separator inconsistency visible in those IDs — `dock_close:editor` against
`picker.rgb.0` — is resolved: `gui.ScopeID` and a single `:` replaced the five
hand-rolled forms. See `docs/specs/widget-id-scoping.md`. The ownership analysis
above stands.)

**Siblings: zero findings.** go-charts (`basic_bar`, `basic_line`) and go-map
(`basic`, `full-map`, `partial-map`, `reference-map`) sweep clean against this
branch. Not sweepable without building their real state: go-charts `showcase`
(still uses the `Color*` fields deleted in §4.4, so it does not compile against
the branch — that is the pending go-charts bump, not a check failure), go-edit
`npad`, go-term `falcon`/`minimal`, go-map `gallery-map`/`stacked-map`.

**A sweep is a lower bound.** It sees one rendered frame, so a hazard behind a
tab, a dialog, or a collapsed panel is invisible until the app is driven into
that state. The 18 are what the default view of each example exposes.

**This did not decide §4.3b** — §4.3.4 does. It replaced the missing number: the
silent class is 18 known sites concentrated in ~6 go-gui widget files, each
fixable ahead of the collapse and verifiable by re-running the sweep.

#### 4.3.4 The collapse, as shipped (v0.55.0)

Done. Nothing is pre-marked. Every callback consumes explicitly. `ctx.Bubble()`
is gone. Landed as three PRs, because the measurement was wrong twice before it
was right.

**The 18 were one anti-idiom.** 14 sites across 12 files wrote
`ctx.Event.IsHandled = true` instead of calling `ctx.Consume()`.
Runtime-identical, but `Consume()` also set `explicitConsume`, the flag
separating "the callback asked" from "dispatch pre-marked" — so every one of
those sites looked like a decision and was a reliance. Swapping all 14 cleared
13 of the 18. The remaining five needed real judgment: the dock close button (4,
inside its own tab button) and the theme picker root (1, hosted as a menu-item
`CustomView`).

**The check was measuring the smaller half.** §4.3.3 asked only whether an
ancestor had a live callback for the same event. But `mouseDownHandler` takes
focus on the way past any focusable shape under the cursor and marks the event
handled doing so, **before any callback runs** (`gui/event_handlers.go:216`). So
an unconsumed click on a non-focusable child inside a focusable ancestor does
not merely fail to stop — it moves focus. No `OnClick` is involved anywhere,
which is why the original check missed it. Widening `ancestorHandler` to count
focus-stealing ancestors, and sweeping all 37 constructible examples rather than
the 8, found 7 more: the colour picker's hue strip and SV area, a slider track
press, the scrollbar gutter's mouse-locked early return, and two in
`gui/datagrid`.

**The static population was 214** — every consume-class callback calling neither
`Consume()` nor `Bubble()`, 81 in `gui/` and 133 in `examples/`. That number is
not a defect count and was never the work: under the new model an app callback
with nothing above it is _correct_ not consuming. The examples needed no changes
at all.

**What the collapse actually broke** was five handlers, and the test suite
caught two of them:

| Site                               | Why it broke                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `view_command_palette.go` backdrop | dismissal must not reach what the palette floats over                                          |
| `view_command_palette.go` card     | **empty body**, whose only job was to stop the backdrop dismissing under a click into the card |
| `view_toast.go`                    | **empty body** — a toast absorbs the clicks it covers                                          |
| `inspector.go`                     | **empty body** — clicks must not reach through and mutate what is under study                  |
| `view_input_date.go` popup         | **empty body** — a click in the popup is not the field's                                       |

Four of five were empty handlers. That is the migration hazard worth publishing:
an empty consume-class callback used to be a working click-blocker, and now
blocks nothing.

**The debug check survives, inverted.** `debugCollapse` measured reliance on a
pre-mark that no longer exists. `debugUnconsumed` reports a handler that acted
without consuming while an ancestor also receives the event, and
`TestEventCollapse` is now `TestUnconsumedEvents`. It has one honest false
positive: deliberate pass-through — a handler that inspects an event, decides it
is not its own and declines — is now the ordinary way to say no, and is
indistinguishable from forgetting. The sweep is a list to read, not a list to
drive to zero.

Sweep across all 37 examples after the collapse: **one finding**, and it is that
false positive — `inputOnClick`'s "no glyph layout, cannot place a cursor" path,
reachable only with a nil `TextMeasurer`, that is, only in tests.

### 4.4 Color-set collapse — highest per-app line savings

`examples/todo/main.go:139-166` sets six `Color*` fields on one button purely to
stop it changing appearance on hover, focus, and click. That is a defaults
failure presenting as API surface. Introduce a shared sub-struct:

```go
type ColorSet struct {
    Base, Hover, Click, Focus, Border, BorderFocus Color
}

// Flat sets every state to c — the common "don't react" case.
func Flat(c Color) ColorSet
```

Unset states fall back to `Base`, `Base` falls back to theme. Removes ~6 lines
per styled widget.

**Precedence, when both a flat `Color*` field and a `ColorSet` are set: the flat
field wins.** This is the only rule that makes the transition safe — existing
code sets flat fields and must keep its current appearance when a `ColorSet`
default arrives, and a partially-migrated literal must not silently change
color. The rule is unintuitive (the newer, more specific-looking API loses), so
it goes in the doc comment on both, not only here.

**The struct does not shrink in phase 3 — it grows.** An additive `ColorSet`
sits _alongside_ the flat fields, so `ContainerCfg` gains a field rather than
losing six. Shrinking requires deleting flat fields, which is breaking and was
not scheduled anywhere. Scheduling it, with one split that the measurement
forces:

- **Delete in phase 4: the five state fields** — `ColorHover`, `ColorFocus`,
  `ColorClick`, `ColorBorder`, `ColorBorderFocus` (`gui/view_button.go:52-61`).
  These are exactly what `ColorSet` replaces, and they are what makes the
  `examples/todo` literal six lines long. Sibling cost is **8 sites, all in
  go-charts**. The other four siblings set none.
- **Keep `Color` permanently**, as shorthand for `ColorSet.Base`. It is the
  single-color case, it is the overwhelmingly common one, and
  `ColorSet{Base: c}` is strictly worse ergonomics for it than `Color: c`.
  Retaining it is not the `InputCfg` two-conventions defect (§3.1), because it
  is not a second way to say the same thing — it is the degenerate case with its
  own name, the same relationship `Flat(c)` has to a fully-specified `ColorSet`.

So the shrink claim survives, at five fields per styled `Cfg` rather than six.
Phase 3 lands `ColorSet` plus the precedence rule. Phase 4 removes the five it
replaced.

A caution on measuring this: a naive `^\s+Color[A-Za-z]*:` grep reports 173
sibling sites, which is off by 20x. Nearly all of them are go-charts' **own**
`Color` field taking a go-gui color _value_ (`Color: gui.Blue`) — the `gui.` on
the line is the palette constant, not the `Cfg`. Match the specific state-field
names.

**Consider, but do not block on:** named theme-backed style presets. The
`examples/todo` button is really asking for "the accent style", not for six
specific colors. A small preset set (primary / secondary / chrome / danger) can
remove more lines than `ColorSet` alone, and the two compose — `ColorSet` is the
mechanism, presets are the vocabulary. Ship `ColorSet` first. Presets are a
separate additive proposal.

#### 4.4.1 Corrections from the implementation (2026-08-07)

**Q5 is reversed: `ColorSet` uses plain `Color`, not `Opt[Color]`.** Q5's
premise — "`Color` has no reserved zero, so a plain field cannot distinguish
'unset, inherit from `Base`' from 'deliberately transparent'" — is false against
the code. `Color` carries its own unexported `set` flag (`gui/color.go:11`),
`Color{}` is unset, and `ColorTransparent = Color{0, 0, 0, 0, true}`
(`gui/color.go:40`) is an explicitly-set transparent color. The distinction
`Opt` was proposed to add already exists, and every widget in the repo already
branches on `Color.IsSet()`.

Wrapping gives the field two independent notions of unset, where `Some(Color{})`
reads as "set to unset" — the same two-conventions defect §3.1 objects to in
`InputCfg`. Pinned by `TestColorSetTransparentIsNotUnset`.

**`Base` does not back the border fields.** §4.4 says "unset states fall back to
`Base`". Applied literally to `Border` that produces a border the same color as
the fill, which reads as _no_ border — not a plausible meaning for omitting the
field. `Base` backs `Hover`, `Click` and `Focus`. `Border` and `BorderFocus`
fall through to the theme, and `BorderFocus` falls back to `Border` first.
`Flat(c)` still pins all six, which is what makes it the "visually inert" case
rather than merely "uniform fill".

**Scoped to `ButtonCfg` in phase 3.** §4.4's phase-4 deletion list names only
`gui/view_button.go:52-61`, so that is the one `Cfg` that gains `Colors`.
`InputCfg` is the obvious next adopter — the same `examples/todo` view sets four
of its color fields — but widening the additive change beyond what the
measurement covered buys nothing before phase 4 removes the flat fields.

The `examples/todo` button is now `Colors: gui.Flat(colorAccent)`, one line
replacing six, which is the saving §4.4 predicted.

#### 4.4.2 Deletion scope, resolved in phase 4 (2026-08-08)

**Deleting only `ButtonCfg`'s five fields makes the API bimodal.** Six `Cfg`s
carry the identical five state-color fields: `ButtonCfg`, `SwitchCfg`,
`ToggleCfg`, `RadioCfg`, `InputDateCfg`, `DatePickerCfg`. Removing them from
`ButtonCfg` alone — which is what §4.4 scheduled — leaves `Switch` and `Toggle`
styled the old way beside a `Button` that uses `Colors`, inside one widget
family. That is worse than the uniform verbosity it replaces.

Resolved by extending `ColorSet` to all six and deleting the five fields on all
six. The 24 `Cfg`s holding a partial set (four fields down to one) keep theirs.
"Carries the full five" is the line, and it is exactly where `ColorSet` fits
without inventing fields a widget does not have.

**The shorthand must not back the interactive states.** `Base` backs `Hover`,
`Click` and `Focus`, so folding the surviving `Color` field into `Base` _before_
that fallback pins all three — and a widget that sets only its background
silently stops reacting to the pointer and to focus. `Color` is applied after
`resolve` instead, leaving the states to the theme exactly as before `ColorSet`
existed.

This was caught by `TestButtonAmendLayoutFocus` going red, not by review, and it
is the kind of change that ships unnoticed: no compile error, no visual
difference until someone tabs to the control. Pinned by
`TestButtonColorShorthandLeavesStatesThemed`.

### 4.5 `Opt[T]` consistency pass and value shorthands

110 `Opt[T]` fields coexist with plain-value fields under no documented rule.

**Decision: `Opt[T]` where the zero value is a legitimate user choice that must
be distinguishable from "unset". Use a plain field everywhere else.** This was
the last §4 item still phrased as an either/or. It blocked phase 3's start. The
rule is not a style preference — it is the only thing that distinguishes the two
cases, and `SizeBorder` is the worked example already in `CLAUDE.md`: a border
width of 0 is a thing a caller means, so a plain field cannot tell "no border"
from "not specified" and silently applies the theme default. Where zero is not
meaningful (most sizes, counts, and indices), `Opt` costs a wrapper call and
buys nothing.

Applying the rule is an audit of the existing 110, not a rewrite: fields that
satisfy it stay, fields that do not become plain in phase 4 with the other
signature changes. Document the rule in `CLAUDE.md` so new `Cfg` fields are
decided at authoring time rather than by whichever neighbor was copied.

Pair either way with cheap value constructors returning the same types the
current wrappers do — these are unaffected by the decision above:

```go
gui.PadAll(12)  // == gui.NewPadding(12, 12, 12, 12)
gui.PadXY(8, 4)
```

#### 4.5.1 Corrections from the implementation (2026-08-07)

**The shorthands already exist, with different return types.**
`PadAll(p) Padding` and `PadTBLR(tb, lr) Padding` are at `gui/padding.go:56` and
`:61`. Redefining `PadAll` to return `Opt[Padding]` is a breaking change to an
exported function used at nine internal sites plus the siblings, and
`PadXY(x, y)` inverts `PadTBLR`'s argument order — a silent swap for anyone who
reaches for the familiar name. `Some(PadAll(12))` already says it with no new
API, so nothing was added. Dropped from phase 3 rather than deferred.

**The field count is 165, not 110.** `grep` for `Opt[` field declarations in
non-test files under `gui/` returns 165. The figure is worth restating because
§4.5 uses it to size the work, and the audit below shows the work is smaller
than either number implies.

**Audit result: the large majority already satisfy the rule.** Grouped by field
family, with counts:

| Family                                            | Count | Verdict                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Padding*`, `*Padding`, `CellSpacing`             | ~45   | keep — zero padding is a real choice, `NoPadding` exists      |
| `SizeBorder`, `Size*Border`                       | ~30   | keep — the worked example. Zero means "no border"             |
| `Radius*`                                         | ~35   | keep — zero means square corners, theme default is not zero   |
| `Spacing*`                                        | ~11   | keep — `NoSpacing` exists                                     |
| `Opacity`, `BgOpacity`, `ParamA/B/D`              | 6     | keep — zero is meaningful                                     |
| `HAlign`, `VAlign`, `Anchor`, `TieOff`, `Mode`    | 7     | keep — enum zero is a real member (`HAlignLeft == 0`)         |
| `Value`, `Min`, `Max`, `Ratio`, `DragStep*`       | 6     | keep — zero is a legitimate slider value                      |
| `Size` (text), `Width*`, `Height`, `Min/MaxWidth` | ~11   | **plain in phase 4** — zero is not a meaningful size          |
| `OffsetX/Y`, `HandleSize`, `DotSize`              | 4     | borderline. Zero is expressible but equals the default anyway |

So §4.5's phase-4 work is roughly **11 fields, not 165**. That is a materially
smaller change than the section implies, and it is the reason the rule is worth
documenting even though almost nothing has to move: the value is in deciding new
fields correctly, not in the cleanup.

#### 4.5.2 `Padding` self-flags, `Opt[Padding]` and `SomeP` removed (2026-08-10, #243)

The rule now reads: **types the repo owns self-flag. Only primitives get
`Opt`.** `Padding` joined `Color` in carrying a `set` field, so "unset" (zero
value, theme default applies) is distinguishable from explicitly zero
(`PaddingNone`) without a wrapper. The 33 `Opt[Padding]` field declarations
became plain `Padding`. `SomeP` was deleted (use `NewPadding`). Read sites moved
from `.Get(def)` to `.Or(def)`. Raw `Padding{...}` literals — even with nonzero
sides — read as unset, so ergoaudit mode `literals` gates them: build with
`NewPadding`/`PadAll`/`PaddingNone`. `ThemeMaker` stamps the flag on its
`cfg.Padding*` copies so a resolved theme value never reads as unset on a later
`IsSet` check. Breaking for consumers of `SomeP` and `Opt[Padding]`. The sibling
repos bump together.

#### 4.5.3 The literal guard extends to `Color` (2026-08-10, #243 follow-up)

Mode `literals` now covers `Color{...}` too: a keyed `gui.Color{R:...}` outside
the package compiles and silently reads as unset, exactly like Padding did. The
empty `Color{}` form stays exempt — it is the explicit spelling of "unset"
(zero-sentinel comparisons, optional color parameters) and behaves like omitting
the value. `glyph.Color{...}` (a foreign type) never flags. The sweep converted
~99 sites to `RGBA(...)`. Two of them (examples/fontviewer,
gui/backend/internal/glyphconv) were genuine silent-unset bugs where the theme
default was applied instead of the color the code wrote. `dimAlpha` dropped its
set-preserving literal for an in-place `c.A /= 2`.

### 4.6 App-testing API — largest additive gap

Apps built on go-gui cannot test behavior. They can only test that a view
function does not panic.

The query half of the story is fine: `FindByID`, `FindLayout`, `FindShape`,
`NextFocusable`, `PreviousFocusable` are all exported (`gui/layout_query.go`).
The **dispatch half is entirely unexported**. `Shape.events` is a lowercase
field (`gui/shape.go:19`) with zero exported accessors, and there is no public
entry point that walks a layout tree and fires handlers.

The library's own tests reach straight through the field:

```go
// gui/view_button_test.go:36 — in-package, so this compiles
layout.Shape.events.OnClick(EventCtx{&layout, e, w})
```

An app author cannot write that line. The measurable consequence: 63 tests
across `examples/*/main_test.go`, and 98 of their assertion lines are some form
of "call `GenerateLayout` and see if it panics." Zero assert that clicking a
button changed state.

This is the gap most worth closing, because immediate mode plus one typed state
slot makes go-gui apps unusually testable _in principle_ — a view is a pure
function of state, so `state → tree → event → state'` is fully deterministic
with no backend, no event loop, and no clock. None of that is reachable from
outside the package.

Proposed surface, additive, no breaking change:

```go
// Build a headless window with injected interfaces left nil.
func NewTestWindow(cfg WindowCfg) *Window

// Render the current view to a tree, then fire a synthetic event at
// the widget with the given ID, running its handler chain.
func (w *Window) TestRender(view ViewFn) *Layout
func (w *Window) TestClick(id string) error
func (w *Window) TestKey(id string, k Key, mods Mod) error
func (w *Window) TestType(id string, text string) error

// Focus assertions. NextFocusable / PreviousFocusable are already
// exported (gui/layout_query.go), so these are thin wrappers.
func (w *Window) TestFocus(id string) error
func (w *Window) TestTab(dir TabDirection) (focusedID string, err error)

// Scroll injection and read-back. The offset getter is the load-bearing
// half: offsets live in an internal StateMap keyed by Shape.ID
// (gui/layout_position.go:71-75) and are unreachable from app code, so
// without it a scroll test can inject but cannot assert.
func (w *Window) TestScroll(id string, dx, dy float32) error
func (w *Window) TestScrollOffset(id string) (x, y float32, err error)
```

`TestTab` matters for phase 4 specifically: the focus unification (§4.2) and the
`Scrollable` work (§4.9) both change tab-order and state-key behavior. Without a
way to assert "tab from A lands on B", that phase ships with no test that
justifies it.

`TestScroll` is not optional either — **Q6's phase gate is undischargeable
without it.** Q6 requires writing the nested-scroll case as a test in phase 2
and changing the propagation model against it. An API with click, key, type,
focus, and tab has no way to express that test. The same pair is what pins
§7.2's silent consume-class regressions, which by construction produce no
compile error.

Errors (not panics) on unknown ID, on a widget with no matching handler, and on
a disabled widget — those are assertion failures in a test, not programmer
errors at a render site.

Two open design points, listed in §9: whether this lives in `gui` or a
`gui/guitest` subpackage, and whether `TestClick` runs full hit-testing from
coordinates or targets the ID directly. Hit-testing is the more faithful
simulation and also catches overlay and z-order bugs. ID-targeting is simpler
and sufficient for state-transition tests.

#### 4.6.1 Corrections from the implementation (2026-08-07)

Shipped in `gui/testing.go`. Three things §4.6 got wrong or left out.

**The hit-testing/ID-targeting choice was a false dichotomy.** §9 Q2 frames them
as alternatives. They are orthogonal: the ID picks a coordinate, and dispatch
then runs full hit-testing from the window root. `TestClick` does both. The
parts of hit-testing worth having — z-order, clipping, disabled subtrees — come
free, because the synthesized event goes through `Window.EventFn` rather than
reaching into `Shape.events`. `TestClickAt(x, y)` is still a separate future
name, but it buys only the ability to click a coordinate that no widget's ID
names.

**Overlay obstruction is not detectable, and §4.6 implied it was.** An overlay
that covers the target consumes the click and marks the event handled, so
`TestClick` returns nil. Dispatch does not record which shape it delivered to,
so "the target handled it" and "something on top of the target handled it" are
the same observation from outside. `ErrTestUnhandled` therefore catches only
total non-delivery. Documented on the method and pinned by
`TestTestClickBlockedByOverlay`. Closing the gap properly means having dispatch
report its recipient — a change on the hottest event path, for a testing
feature, and not worth it at this stage.

**`TestScroll` must send a precise scroll, not a wheel notch.** Not a
preference. The discrete-wheel path does not move the offset at all:
`scrollSmoothBy` arms an exponential ease that lands over later frames driven by
the animation goroutine, which no headless test runs — and `clearHotMaps` calls
`scrollSmoothReset` on every view rebuild, so settling a frame discards the
in-flight ease regardless. Only `scrollVertical`/`scrollHorizontal`, the
precise/trackpad path, write synchronously. Consequence for callers: a widget
branching on `Event.ScrollPrecise` sees the trackpad branch under test.

### 4.7 Naming: `RTF` / `RtfCfg` casing split

`RTF(cfg RtfCfg)` (`gui/view_rtf.go:212`) is the only factory whose name
disagrees with its `Cfg` in casing. Go convention initializes acronyms
uniformly, so this is `RTF(cfg RTFCfg)`. Breaking rename. Fold into phase 4
where consumers already migrate.

**Also in phase 4: rename `OnCellFormat` and `OnDetailRowView` out of the `On*`
space.** §4.3 argues they are misnamed — they are view builders that return a
value, not event callbacks — but named no phase, which means either another
breaking release or keeping a misnomer §8 already expects the next reviewer to
trip on. Phase 4 is the only bus it can ride. Cost is zero outside the declaring
package: no reference to either identifier exists in any of the five siblings,
or anywhere in go-gui outside `gui/datagrid/`. Suggested `CellFormat` and
`DetailRowView`, matching the `Cfg`-field-as-builder convention rather than the
callback one.

The other twelve factory/`Cfg` name divergences are deliberate and stay: the
container family (`Column`, `Row`, `Wrap`, `Canvas`, `Circle`) intentionally
shares `ContainerCfg`, and `RadioButtonGroupColumn` / `RadioButtonGroupRow`
follow the same axis-variant pattern.

### 4.8 Example audit: `FillFill` vs manual viewport math

`examples/get_started/main.go:36` documents that `FillFill` removes the need for
`WindowSize()` and manual arithmetic. **45 example files call `WindowSize()`
anyway** — 50 call sites and 108 lines of `float32(ww)-N` arithmetic. This is
not one contradictory pair. It is the dominant idiom in the examples, teaching
the opposite of what the library recommends.

Treat it as an audit, not a file fix:

1. Convert to `FillFill` wherever the size is only used to fill the window or
   subtract padding.
2. Keep an explicit allowlist for examples that genuinely need viewport numbers
   — canvas, particle, game, and shader demos that compute positions in pixel
   space. Document _why_ in each.
3. Once converted, the remaining `WindowSize()` calls are a signal rather than
   noise.

The highest-impact change for _perceived_ ergonomics: the examples are where the
idiom is learned, and right now they teach manual layout.

Also convert two or three example tests from no-panic assertions to real
state-transition assertions once §4.6 lands, so the testing pattern is
demonstrated rather than described.

#### 4.8.1 Audit result (2026-08-08)

**45 files / 50 call sites → 8 files / 9 call sites.** 37 files converted. 8
allowlisted, each with a one-line reason at the call site so the remaining calls
read as deliberate.

Most of the conversion was one shape repeated 34 times: fetch the window size,
set it as the root's `Width`/`Height`, and mark the root `FixedFixed`. That is
`Sizing: gui.FillFill` and nothing else. Six cases carried real arithmetic:

| Example            | Was                                 | Now                                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `todo`             | `cardView(ww-24, wh-24, w)`         | card is `FillFill` inside the page's 12px padding |
| `listbox`          | `Height: float32(wh) - 70`          | list `FillFill` takes the column remainder        |
| `minesweeper`      | `ww, wh` threaded into both screens | both screens `FillFill`, params dropped           |
| `2048`             | window size in both screens         | `gameView` `FillFill`, landing still needs it     |
| `snake`            | window size in both screens         | play screen `FillFill`, landing still needs it    |
| `animation_stress` | window size in three places         | root `FillFill`, two spawn helpers still need it  |

**The allowlist, with the reason each one is real:**

| Example            | Why the viewport is genuinely needed                                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `calculator`       | root is a `Canvas`, which does not arrange, so its centring child cannot Fill |
| `digital_rain`     | grid columns/rows are the viewport divided by the character cell              |
| `fontviewer`       | virtualization: `ListVisibleRange` needs the viewport height before arrange   |
| `particles`        | particle field is simulated in pixel space                                    |
| `solitaire`        | cards, status bar and win overlay at absolute positions                       |
| `2048` (landing)   | backdrop tiles at computed pixel coordinates                                  |
| `snake` (landing)  | same, plus a backdrop sized `ww-64` × `wh-88`                                 |
| `animation_stress` | random spawn and retarget coordinates                                         |

**`calculator` is the one that failed.** It was converted, measured, and
reverted: with the inner column set to `FillFill`, a probe read the child as
**0×0** against an 800×600 root. `Canvas` "does not arrange or layout its
content" (`gui/view_container.go:454`), so a Fill child of a Canvas has nothing
to fill against. The revert is the finding, and the comment at the call site now
records it.

Verification is by probe, not by absence of panic. Renders at 800×600 verified
the converted view roots fill exactly 800×600 (`markdown`, `context_menu`,
`dock_layout`, `scroll_demo` — covering a scrollable root and a
non-`ContainerCfg` root), that `todo`'s card resolves to 773×573 inside the
page's 12px padding and 1.5px border, and that `listbox`'s list still gets a
real height (534.6) from Fill rather than from `wh - 70`.

**Test conversion.** Three examples moved from `TestMainViewNoPanic` to state
assertions: `key_up_demo` (one `TestKey` moves both the down and up counters,
which a no-panic render cannot distinguish), `todo` (`TestType` + `TestClick`
grows the list, clears the draft. A second test deletes by generated per-item
ID), and `dialogs` (clicking `dlg_message` puts the dialog overlay in the tree).

`scroll_demo` was attempted and abandoned: `TestScroll` returns
`ErrTestUnhandled` because with a nil `TextMeasurer` the content does not
overflow, so there is nothing to scroll. Scroll assertions need a container
whose overflow does not depend on measured text.

**Resolved (v0.55.1, §4.8.2).** Both blockers are fixed and `scroll_demo` now
carries the two state assertions it was meant to have.

**Found, not fixed:** `examples/scroll_demo/main.go:111` gives all five
percentage buttons the same ID, `"scroll_demo_pct_button"`. IDs must be unique
per window. This is a §4.2-class defect, out of scope for a sizing audit, and it
makes those buttons untargetable by ID from a test.

#### 4.8.2 The headless-overflow gap, as closed

The diagnosis in the paragraph above was right about the symptom and wrong about
the mechanism. Text is _not_ zero-sized without a `TextMeasurer`:
`Window.TextWidth` falls back to `0.6em` per rune and `view_text.go` seeds a
`1.4em` height, so a single-line label has a plausible size headlessly. What is
missing is the second pass. `layoutPlainText` recomputes height after sizing —
that is where a wrapped paragraph learns it is 40 lines tall — and it returned
immediately when `w.textMeasurer == nil`. Wrapped text therefore kept its
**one-line seed** no matter how much text it held. Measured on a 1000-rune
paragraph in a 200×100 container: content height 22.4 against a 77px viewport,
so no overflow, so no scroll.

Two changes:

**`plainTextHeightNoMeasurer` (`gui/text_layout.go`)** estimates the wrapped
height from the same per-rune approximation the width fallback already uses:
hard lines split on `\n`, each divided by the resolved width, times a shared
`fallbackLineHeight`. The same paragraph now measures 1232px and the container
overflows. It is an estimate of an estimate — right for "does this overflow",
wrong for any pixel assertion, which is already `NewTestWindow`'s documented
contract. It walks the string with `strings.IndexByte` rather than
`strings.Split`, because this runs once per text shape inside the layout walk
and a `Split` heap-allocates on every one.

**`ErrTestNoScrollRoom` (`gui/testing.go`)** is the diagnostic half. Even with
the estimate, a fixture whose content genuinely fits still failed with a bare
`ErrTestUnhandled`, which reads as "some widget swallowed your event". The two
conditions call for opposite fixes — one says the fixture has nothing to scroll,
the other says the container is real but already pinned at its limit — so they
are now separate errors, and the message carries the content and viewport sizes
that decided it. Room is measured exactly as `layoutAdjustScrollOffsets` clamps,
so the error cannot disagree with the clamp that swallowed the scroll.

Verified in both directions: the wrapped-text scroll test fails with
`ErrTestUnhandled` before the estimate and passes after, and the existing
`TestTestScrollClampsAtEnd` still gets `ErrTestUnhandled` at the limit rather
than the new error. Full suite green, no benchmark movement —
`plainTextNeedsGlyphLayout` gates the new path behind non-single-line text,
which the hot-path benchmarks do not use.

### 4.9 Close the `Scrollable`/ID hole alongside focus

Same defect class as §4.2, found by the same audit. Scroll offsets are keyed by
`Shape.ID` (`gui/layout_position.go:71-75`):

```go
if v, ok := sx.Get(layout.Shape.ID); ok { x += v }
```

An empty ID is a valid map key, so **every ID-less scrollable in a window shares
the key `""`** and they scroll in lockstep. That is worse than the focus hole:
focus without an ID is inert, but scroll without an ID is cross-widget state
bleed.

Current coverage of the 7 `Cfg`s exposing `Scrollable bool`:

| Guard                  | Cfgs                                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `gui:"required"` tag   | Combobox, CommandPalette, ListBox, Table, |
|                        | Tree                                      |
| `RequireScrollID` only | Container (`gui/view_container.go:342`)   |
| **none**               | **Input**                                 |

`RequireScrollID` (`gui/state_registry.go:143`) is **not** dead the way
`RequireFocusID` was — it has exactly one caller. So finish wiring it rather
than deleting it. The analyzer has zero `Scrollable` references.

**Correction (2026-08-07, phase 1).** An earlier draft claimed one live defect
here: "`gui/view_select.go:145` builds the dropdown container with
`Scrollable: true` and no ID." That is **false**, and it was false at this
spec's own base commit. The literal sets `ID: dropdownScrollID` (=
`cfg.ID + ".dropdown"`) at line 130. `Scrollable: true` sits fifteen lines below
it at line 145, and the original reading took the second line without the first.

Re-verified every `Scrollable: true` literal in `gui/` — command palette,
inspector, table, theme picker, select, datagrid body — and **all six already
carry an ID**. There are zero live scroll defects. The rest of this section
still stands as a guard: the contract is unenforced even though nothing
currently violates it.

Proposed, all additive except the tag:

- Tag `ID` on `ContainerCfg` and `InputCfg`. Wire `RequireScrollID` into
  `Input`.
- Add a `checkScrollableID` rule to `tools/requiredid`, mirroring
  `checkFocusableID` — same shape, small diff.
- Add the `Scrollable && ID == ""` check to the §4.1 debug gate, which catches
  internal shapes the analyzer never sees. Phase 1, alongside the focus work:
  same mechanism, same audit. Note that this is now purely preventive — see the
  correction above.

`ContainerCfg` is the only type that is both opt-in-focusable and scrollable
(`Focusable` :97, `Scrollable` :102, `ID` :67). With §4.2's opt-in collapse cut,
that is unremarkable: both concerns key off the same `ID` field,
`checkScrollableID` needs to know nothing about focus, and nothing here carries
into phase 4.

## 5. Rejected

### 5.1 Positional auto-generated IDs

Proposed as deriving stable IDs from tree position at layout time, like React
keys, with an explicit `ID` as an override. **Reject.**

IDs are not merely focus tokens — they are the identity key for all cross-frame
widget state. 242 `StateMap[string, …]` sites key off `Shape.ID`: scroll offsets
(`gui/layout_position.go:71`), overflow counts (`gui/layout_overflow.go:59`),
dropdown open state (`gui/layout_overflow.go:65`). Positional identity is stable
only while tree structure is stable — and React needs explicit keys _because_
that assumption fails on insert and reorder.

Concretely: insert a row at the top of a list and every row below inherits the
previous occupant's scroll position and open-dropdown state. That trades a loud
analyzer error for silent state corruption, contradicting the proposal's own
"never a silent no-op" principle. §4.2 addresses the real complaint without
touching identity semantics.

### 5.2 Variadic modifier helpers

Proposed as `gui.Row(gui.Pad(8), gui.Gap(4), children...)`, claimed to allocate
nothing at build time. **Reject — the claim is inverted.** Variadic interface
parameters allocate a backing slice plus one boxing allocation per modifier, per
widget, per frame. That is the functional- options allocation pattern the
proposal claims to avoid. The view phase is already the sole per-frame allocator
(pipeline, arrange, and render are zero-alloc), so this worsens the one hot
spot. Struct literals allocate nothing extra. Keep them and add value
constructors (§4.5).

### 5.3 `State[T]` returning an error instead of panicking

Keep the panic. A window holding the wrong state type is a programmer error
discoverable at first render, not a runtime condition worth threading through
every view function. Improve the message instead — report the type held and the
type requested (§4.1).

**Versions — superseded, see the correction below.** The original plan: phases
1–3 are additive and ship as `v0.52.x` point releases, phase 4 is the single
breaking release **v0.53.0**, and phase 5 rides whatever follows.

**Correction (2026-08-07).** Phase 1 shipped as **v0.53.0** and it is breaking.
Two errors above:

1. **Phase 1 is not non-breaking.** The footnote below reasons only about the
   `gui:"required"` tag being inert in a repo that does not invoke the analyzer.
   That much is true and was verified. But §4.2 also wires `RequireID` into the
   same nine factories, and a panic in `Button` is breaking whether or not
   anyone runs the tool. Measured rather than argued: go-charts and go-map each
   had example code that panics at runtime on a routine bump — 3 sites, exactly
   the count §7 predicted, reached by a mechanism §6 claimed unreachable.
2. **v0.53.0 is consumed.** Phase 4 needs **v0.54.0**.

Revised: phase 1 = v0.53.0 (breaking, shipped). Phases 2–3 additive as
`v0.53.x`. Phase 4 = v0.54.0, the second breaking release. Phase 5 rides
whatever follows.

The two breaking releases are not a regression against "one breaking release":
phase 1's break is a runtime panic on a config that was already broken, and
phase 4's is a compile-time signature change. Bundling them delays the a11y fix
behind the event refactor.

§4.6 moves ahead of the cosmetic work deliberately: a color-set refactor (§4.4)
and an event-model change (§4.3) both alter behavior that apps currently cannot
assert on. Landing the test API first means the later phases ship with
regression coverage instead of hoping the examples still look right.

\* **Wrong — see the correction above.** Retained because the reasoning about
the analyzer is sound and worth keeping. The conclusion it feeds is not. Phase 1
is non-breaking **for consumers**. It removes one exported symbol with zero call
sites anywhere (pre-1.0, no compatibility promise below v1), and adding
`gui:"required"` to the 9 `Cfg`s breaks only go-gui's own callers — 111 of them,
all in this repo's tests and examples, surfaced by `requiredid` in CI rather
than at runtime. The 3 sibling sites wait for phase 4 with the rest of the
migration.

That last claim depends on siblings not running the analyzer, so it was verified
rather than assumed. `requiredid` is not a `go vet` plugin registered by
importing go-gui. It is a standalone binary invoked explicitly (`Makefile:104`
and `.github/workflows/ci.yml:155` both run
`go run ./tools/requiredid/cmd/requiredid ./...`). All five siblings run plain
`go vet ./...`, which does not load it. Tagging the 9 `Cfg`s therefore cannot
turn a sibling's CI red on a routine version bump — the tags are inert in any
repo that does not invoke the tool. If a sibling later adopts `requiredid`, it
adopts the backlog at that moment by choice.

Phase 4 must be a single release. Three breaking event refactors in consecutive
versions is worse for consumers than one larger one.

### 6.1 Progress

Phase 1 ships as a series of PRs rather than one, so the 111 mechanical `ID`
insertions land isolated from the hand-written changes instead of burying them
in the same diff.

Two corrections to §4.2 arising from the implementation.

**The guard is scoped, not unconditional.** §4.2 says to wire `RequireID` into
the nine factories. Wiring it unconditionally panics on legitimate code:
`FocusDisabled: true` is the documented opt-out for a decorative control, and
there is a live one — the date picker's blank out-of-month cell — plus test
cases that exercise the opt-out. The tag gained an option,
`gui:"required,focus"`, and the runtime guard an unexported `requireFocusID`
that honors the same exemption. This is the predicate the deleted
`RequireFocusID` encoded, inverted for the default-on convention. Keeping it at
the call site rather than behind an export makes the condition visible where it
applies.

**`ID` is not only a focus key.** §4.2 frames a missing `ID` as a focus defect,
but `layout_pipeline.go` also skips `OnMouseLeave` dispatch on an empty `ID`,
with no `Focusable` precondition. A `FocusDisabled` control carrying an
`OnMouseLeave` is therefore still silently broken, and neither
`ergonomics-audit -mode focus` nor the §4.1 gate looks for it. Added to the
table above as a §4.1 check rather than widening the runtime guard, since the
opt-out is otherwise correct.

**§4.9's tag is struck, not deferred.** Two of its three items do not apply as
written. The runtime guard already exists —
`RequireScrollID("container", cfg.Scrollable, cfg.ID)` in `buildContainerShape`,
wired all along. `ergonomics-audit` listed `ContainerCfg` as unguarded because
it judges by tag, not by call site. And tagging `ContainerCfg.ID` is wrong: most
containers legitimately have no ID, so a `required` tag on a normally-absent
field inverts the default and flags the common case. The rule is conditional on
`Scrollable: true`, which is exactly how `checkFocusableID` already handles
`Focusable: true` — keyed on the field in the literal, no tag. So §4.9 reduces
to the analyzer rule, which is what shipped.

`InputCfg` also dropped out of the scrollable gap on its own: phase 1 made its
`ID` unconditionally required, which subsumes the scroll case. `ContainerCfg`
was the only remaining entry.

**Codemod scope note.** The 111 figure included one false positive:
`CommandButton(cmdID, ButtonCfg{})` fills the `ID` in itself, so the empty `ID`
at that call site is fine. `ergonomics-audit` no longer counts a literal passed
to a factory other than its own, matching what `requiredid` and the runtime
guard already did.

## 7. Sibling impact

All five siblings pin `go-gui v0.52.0`. `main` is v0.52.1, so these counts
reflect the current API. Measured with `go/ast` walks over each repo
(`scratchpad/siblingimpact.go`).

| Item                      | Forced sibling edits         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| §4.2 default-on `ID`      | 3 (go-charts 1, go-map 2)    |
| §4.3a finish `EventCtx`   | **0**                        |
| §4.3b delete `Bubble()`   | 7 (go-edit 5, go-term 2)     |
| §4.7 `RTF` rename         | **0** — no sibling uses it   |
| §4.7 datagrid builders    | **0** — no sibling reference |
| §4.4 `ColorSet` (phase 3) | 0 — additive with fallback   |
| §4.4 drop 5 state colors  | 8 (go-charts 8)              |
| §4.6 test API             | 0 — purely additive          |
| **Total**                 | **18 call sites**            |

Eighteen edits across five repos, all mechanical. The cost of the whole breaking
release is smaller than the cost of one of its parts was assumed to be.

Two rows moved after review. The `ColorSet` row was `0` until the flat-field
deletion was scheduled (§4.4). An additive-only reading scored it zero and
quietly deferred the real number — `Color` is retained, so only the five state
fields count. The `gui.Focus` row was 11 until §4.2's opt-in collapse was cut.
Those 11 sites are correct as written today and now require no edit at all.
**Only 3 of the remaining 18 come from §4.2**, and none of those 3 is a breaking
API change — they are IDs that were needed regardless.

### 7.1 How the §4.3 boundary was measured

§4.3 states the conclusion. This is the derivation. A naive count finds 38
`*Window`-tailed callback literals in the siblings. None is forced work:

| Category                            | Sites | Verdict          |
| ----------------------------------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| `OnInit` (`WindowCfg` lifecycle)    | 13    | keep `*Window`   |
| `OnDone` / `OnValue` (anim, dialog) | 12    | keep `*Window`   |
| go-map's own `OnClick`              | 10    | not go-gui's API |
| go-edit's own `OnFileDrop`          | 3     | not go-gui's API |

The last two are sibling-defined fields that merely mirror go-gui's older
convention — `go-map/mapview/overlay.go:104` declares
`OnClick func(*gui.Window)`, and `go-edit/edit/editor.go:53` declares
`OnFileDrop func(path string, w *gui.Window)`. Renaming go-gui's signatures does
not touch them. They become _stylistically_ out of step, which is a follow-suit
invitation, not a migration.

The first two categories are what drove the §4.3 scope correction: they are
go-gui's own callbacks, and they legitimately have no event to carry. §4.3 now
lists the 14 excluded signatures directly.

### 7.2 The §4.3b risk is silent, not loud

Deleting `Bubble()` breaks 7 sites loudly — a compile error the consumer cannot
miss. That is the safe part.

The unsafe part is unmeasurable by counting: under the one-rule collapse, a
consume-class handler that relied on dispatch's automatic handled-marking and
never called `Consume()` will start bubbling. That is a **behavior change with
no compile error**. Siblings already call `Consume()` 71 times, so the idiom is
well established, but any handler that omitted it because the auto-mark made it
unnecessary changes meaning silently.

This is the strongest argument for landing §4.6's test API first (phase 2):
event-propagation regressions are precisely what an app-level test can catch and
a compiler cannot.

**Resolved (v0.55.0, §4.3.4).** The argument held, and the test API paid for
itself: of the five go-gui handlers the collapse actually broke, the suite
caught two on the first run. The silent class turned out to be smaller and more
specific than "any handler that omitted `Consume()`" — it is the **empty**
handler, whose only function was to trigger the pre-mark. Four of the five were
empty bodies.

### 7.3 Reproducing these counts

Every figure in this spec comes from `tools/ergonomics-audit`, which is
committed to the repo:

```
go run ./tools/ergonomics-audit/ -mode focus     -gui . . ../go-charts ../go-edit ../go-kite ../go-term ../go-map
go run ./tools/ergonomics-audit/ -mode callbacks -gui . . ../go-charts ../go-edit ../go-kite ../go-term ../go-map
```

or `make ergonomics-audit` for the go-gui-only run. Mode `focus` **derives** the
unguarded `Cfg` set from the source instead of hardcoding it, so the numbers
track the code — and the per-file scan that once misreported `ListBoxCfg` cannot
recur.

**Sibling figures published before 2026-08-08 are not reliable.** Mode
`callbacks` counted any `OnX: func(..., *Window)` literal regardless of which
module declared the field, so sibling numbers included the siblings' own
callbacks. It now splits the two. Only the "go-gui fields" figure is a migration
cost. See §4.3.1 for that fix and two others in the same mode.

## 8. Doc deliverables

- `README.md` — color-set and padding-shorthand examples, and a "testing your
  app" section (§4.6)
- `CHANGELOG.md` — per phase
- `CLAUDE.md` — event-model section rewritten for the single rule (§4.3)
- `docs/specs/eventctx-callback-refactor.md` — mark superseded by §4.3
- `docs/specs/idfocus-to-focusable.md` — decision 3 cites `RequireID`
  enforcement for `Focusable: true`. Amend it to record that the runtime guard
  was never wired and is now deleted in favor of the analyzer plus the debug
  gate (§4.2)
- **Phase-4 migration guide** (new, `docs/migration-v0.53.md` or similar). 18
  sibling sites plus ~126 ID fills are mechanical, and §7.2's silent half is not
  — a before/after for `Focus`, `Consume`, and `ColorSet` is cheap insurance.
- **`ergonomics-audit -fix`** (new, phase 1). Not "consider" — commit to it.
  Phase 1 alone rewrites 111 internal literals to add `ID` fields, and phase 4
  adds ~15 more. That is a week of mechanical edits done by hand, and
  hand-editing 111 literals is how a typo'd ID reaches `main` looking like
  intent. The `go/ast` `CompositeLit` walk that finds them is already written
  and tested in `tools/ergonomics-audit`, so `-fix` is an insertion pass on top
  of the existing classifier, not a new tool. IDs derive from the enclosing file
  and variable name and are **written into the source literal** — this does not
  reopen §5.1, which rejects IDs _computed at runtime from tree position_. A
  generated ID in the file is an ordinary ID that a human can read, review, and
  edit. The rejected design has no source-level existence and changes when a
  sibling is inserted. If the codemod is worth shipping for siblings, it is
  worth running on the 111 first — where its output is reviewable in the same PR
  that adds the tags.
- **Two callback families, documented as intentional** (godoc + `CLAUDE.md`).
  Event-driven takes `EventCtx`. Lifecycle, animation, and completion take
  `func(T…, *Window)`. Writing this down is what stops the next reviewer
  reopening §4.3 as "unfinished `EventCtx`".
- **How to run `requiredid` in your own build** (new, `README.md` plus the
  phase-4 migration guide). Phase 1 is the release that makes `gui:"required"`
  load-bearing, and it is enforcement only in repos that invoke the analyzer —
  see §4.2. Give authors the one-line invocation, the `go vet -vettool=` and
  golangci-lint plugin alternatives, and one sentence on what they get without
  it: a `RequireID` panic on first render rather than a build failure. This is
  the cheapest item on the list and the one that decides whether the §4.2
  enforcement story is true for anyone but this repo.
- affected per-example `README.md` files

## 9. Open questions

Two independent reviews agreed with every recommendation below, so Q1–Q7 are
decisions rather than questions. Q6 remains a **phase gate**: agreed in
approach, but it must be discharged by work in phase 2 before phase 4 can
proceed. Q8 was resolved on 2026-08-07, before phase 1 shipped.

| #   | Topic                    | Decision                             |
| --- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Test API location        | package `gui`                        |
| 2   | Click model              | ID-targeting v1, `TestClickAt` later |
| 3   | Nested focus             | unexported `Shape` helper            |
| 4   | Focusable without ID     | proceed, mandatory `ID`              |
| 5   | `ColorSet` zero value    | plain `Color` (reversed, see §4.4.1) |
| 6   | Nested `OnMouseScroll`   | gate written 2026-08-07, see below   |
| 7   | Breaking release target  | v0.54.0 (revised, see §6)            |
| 8   | `requiredid` for authors | **documented only** (2026-08-07)     |

Detail where the decision carries a constraint:

1. **Test API in `gui`.** A `gui/guitest` subpackage cannot reach `Shape.events`
   without exporting it, permanently widening the public surface to serve
   testing. Four exported names in an already-953-symbol package is the cheaper
   trade.
2. **ID-targeting for v1.** Answers the state-transition question that 63
   example tests cannot answer today. Hit-testing arrives later as a separate
   `TestClickAt(x, y)` — never by changing `TestClick`'s meaning, which silently
   reinterprets existing tests.
3. **Nested focus via an unexported `Shape` helper.** Compound widgets that mark
   an internal child focusable get an internal path to propagate an ID derived
   from the parent's, so `Cfg.ID` stays the only public spelling.
4. **~~`Opt[Color]` for `ColorSet`.~~ Reversed 2026-08-07 during implementation
   — see §4.4.1.** The original reasoning was: "`Color` has no reserved zero, so
   a plain field cannot distinguish 'unset, inherit from `Base`' from
   'deliberately transparent' — and fallback is the entire point of the type."
   That premise is false against the code. `Color` has carried its own `set`
   flag all along, so the distinction exists without a wrapper and adding one
   gives the field two competing notions of unset. Shipped as plain `Color`.
   `Flat(c)` survives unchanged as the all-states shorthand.
5. **Nested scroll is the one real risk.** Under the one-rule collapse a nested
   scrollable that today relies on notify-class propagation to hand an
   unconsumed scroll to its parent changes behavior with **no compile error** —
   the silent class from §7.2. Discharge it by writing the nested-scroll case as
   a test in phase 2, then changing the model against it. That test is only
   writable if phase 2 ships `TestScroll` and `TestScrollOffset` (§4.6) —
   without an offset read-back the case can be injected but not asserted, and
   the gate cannot be discharged. This is also why §4.9 belongs in phase 1:
   scroll-state keying and scroll propagation must not both be in motion at
   once.

   **Written 2026-08-07** as `gui/scroll_nested_test.go`. The current contract
   holds: an inner scrollable pinned at its limit declines the scroll, and
   traversal unwinds to the enclosing container in the same gesture. Verified to
   fire by mutation — forcing `IsHandled = true` on a scrollable under the
   cursor turns `TestNestedScrollCascadesToParentAtLimit` red with a message
   naming Q6. Phase 4 now has something concrete to break, and breaking it is a
   decision that has to be argued here rather than a silent behavior change.

   One incidental finding: the cascade is not assertable after the fact. Once
   the outer container scrolls, the inner one is carried out of view and has no
   clip to aim a follow-up scroll at, so the test must assert across the single
   gesture where the handoff happens.

6. **v0.54.0** for the §4.3/§4.4/§4.7 breaking phase. Phases 2–3 as `v0.53.x`.
   Revised from the original "v0.53.0, one breaking release" — phase 1 turned
   out to be breaking and consumed that version. The 18 remaining sibling edits
   still land in one release. See §6.
7. **`requiredid` for app authors — resolved 2026-08-07: documented only.** It
   stays a `tools/` binary that authors can invoke. The README carries the
   one-line invocation and the `go vet -vettool=` and golangci-lint
   alternatives, plus one sentence on what an author gets without it: a
   `RequireID` panic on first render rather than a build failure. The analyzer's
   rules stay free to tighten, because nothing promises they will not. The
   consequence accepted with this choice is that most consumers sit on the
   `RequireID`-panic path by default, and §4.2's static-enforcement claim
   remains true for this repo alone.

   The alternatives, recorded because the trade is not obvious:

   - **Documented only.** It stays a `tools/` binary that authors can invoke.
     Its rules can tighten freely, because nothing promises they will not. Costs
     nothing. Leaves most consumers on the `RequireID`-panic path by default.
   - **Supported.** Named in the README as part of the recommended setup,
     versioned with the library, plausibly a `go tool` directive. Makes §4.2's
     static-enforcement claim true for everyone — and makes the analyzer's rules
     API. Tightening a rule then breaks somebody's build on a patch bump, which
     is exactly the failure mode `deps-doc` and the alloc gates exist to avoid.

   Chosen "documented only" because the support commitment buys little that the
   `RequireID` panic does not already buy loudly, and costs the freedom to
   tighten a rule without turning somebody's build red on a patch bump — the
   failure mode `deps-doc` and the alloc gates exist to avoid. Revisit if a
   sibling adopts the analyzer and asks for a stability promise.

## 10. Counting rules

§1's figures are not re-derivable without these. All against `main` @ `80715d1`,
`_test.go` excluded unless stated.

**Callback declarations — the unit is a (field name, signature) pair.**
`ergonomics-audit -mode callbacks` walks `gui/` with `go/ast`, collects every
exported `On*` field whose type is a `func`, and keys the dedupe on the field
name joined to the `go/printer` rendering of its type. So `OnDone func(*Window)`
and `OnDone func(NativeAlertResult, *Window)` are two entries, and an identical
shape declared under two names stays two entries. **136 raw declarations reduce
to 70 distinct pairs.** Scope is `gui/*.go` plus `gui/*/*.go`. `_test.go`
excluded.

Text dedupe does not reproduce this. An earlier `grep | sort -u` pass reported
120, because gofmt aligns field types to the widest name in each struct, so one
signature counts once per distinct indentation. `TestRenderExprNormalises` pins
the AST rendering against that.

**Shape breakdown.** Of the 70 distinct pairs: **16** bare `func(EventCtx)`,
**19** `func(T…, EventCtx)`, **27** with a trailing `*Window`, **6** exposing a
raw `*Event`, **2** in none of these (`OnAction func(id string)` and
`OnDraw func(*DrawContext)`, which take neither a window nor a context). The two
view builders `OnCellFormat` and `OnDetailRowView` are _not_ in that last
bucket: they end in `*gg.Window` and so count inside the 27, which is where §4.3
excludes them. Of the 27 `*Window`-tailed, **14 are excluded** by §4.3 as
lifecycle/dialog callbacks that have no event to carry, leaving **13 to
convert**. §4.3 lists all 14 by name. That list, not this count, is the phase-4
work item.

The raw-`*Event` figure is 6, not the 5 a `grep '\*Event'` finds: two are
declared in the `datagrid` subpackage as the qualified `*gg.Event`
(`OnColumnPinChange`, `OnCopyRows`). `baseType` strips the package qualifier.
`TestBaseType` pins it. Counted as declaration _lines_ instead of pairs the
figure is 7 — `OnEvent func(*Event, *Window)` is declared twice
(`gui/window_cfg.go:14`, `gui/window.go:168`) with an identical signature and
collapses to one pair.

**`Opt[T]` fields — approximate.** 110 counts occurrences of `Opt[` in
`gui/view_*.go` field position, which includes non-`Cfg` structs. Treat as an
order-of-magnitude figure for "how much of the surface uses `Opt`", not an exact
field census.

**`Color*` field names — approximate.** "20+" counts distinct
`^\tColor[A-Za-z]*` field names across `gui/view_*.go` and does not separate
`Cfg` fields from helpers. The load-bearing claim is the six fields on one
`ButtonCfg` literal in `examples/todo/main.go:139-166`, which is exact.

**`Focusable` groups.** 12 and 15 count _`Cfg` types_. The raw `Focusable bool`
inventory also matches `Shape` (`gui/shape.go:120`), `termgrid`, and
`inspector`, which are excluded as not app-facing.

**Required-tag audit.** Per-struct, not per-file: `awk` scoped to the struct
containing the `FocusDisabled` field. A file-level `grep -m1` gives the wrong
answer where a file declares several `Cfg` types — that error is what originally
misclassified `ListBoxCfg` as untagged.

**Literal audit (§4.2, §7).** `go/ast` `CompositeLit` walk over each repo,
skipping `vendor/`, `.git/`, `testdata/`. `ID` counts as present unless absent
or the literal `""`. A computed `ID` that evaluates empty at runtime counts as
present, so 126 is a floor. Tests included and labeled separately.

**`WindowSize()` audit.** Call _expressions_ under `examples/`, excluding
`_test.go` and excluding the one occurrence in prose — the comment at
`examples/get_started/main.go:36` that this section quotes. Counting that line
as a call gives 46/51 instead of 45/50.
