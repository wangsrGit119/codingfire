# Cancelling an in-flight `MouseLock`

Status: implemented. Issue #110.

## Problem

`MouseLock` is cleared only by an explicit `MouseUnlock`, and for every widget
that call lives in the lock's `MouseUp`. That is correct exactly as long as a
press is always followed by a release the app can see.

Windows does not guarantee that. `SetCapture`/`ReleaseCapture` are paired with
the button state in `mouseButton` (`gui/backend/gl/events_win32.go`), but Win32
can revoke capture on its own — another process calls `SetCapture`, a system
modal or UAC prompt appears, Ctrl+Alt+Del or Win+L fires, a debugger breaks in.
The window then gets `WM_CAPTURECHANGED` and no `WM_LBUTTONUP`. The message was
unhandled, so the lock survived and `mouseMoveHandler` kept routing every later
move into the drag callback: text selection tracking a cursor with no button
held, cleared only by a fresh click.

macOS had the same symptom from a different cause (a resize-border press whose
mouse-up AppKit swallowed), fixed separately in `metal_window_darwin.m`. X11 is
not affected: reparenting WMs own the resize borders on the frame window, and
X's implicit passive grab guarantees the matching `ButtonRelease`.

## Why not synthesize a `MouseUp`

`MouseUp` is the _commit_. Dock drops call `onLayoutChange`, drag-reorder calls
`onReorder`. Feeding a fake release on capture loss docks a panel or reorders a
list the user never dropped — a data mutation from an event that did not happen.
Cancellation is a distinct outcome and needs a distinct hook.

## Design

`MouseLockCfg.Cancel func(*Window)`, plus `(*Window).MouseCancel()`:

```go
func (w *Window) MouseCancel() {
	if !w.mouseIsLocked() {
		return
	}
	cancel := w.viewState.mouseLock.Cancel
	w.MouseUnlock()
	if cancel != nil {
		cancel(w)
	}
	w.InvalidateLayout()
}
```

Three properties the tests pin (`gui/mouse_cancel_test.go`):

- **Unlocks unconditionally.** `Cancel` is optional — a widget whose only drag
  state _is_ the lock (scrollbar, splitter, markdown selection) needs no hook,
  and the default already restores it.
- **Clears the lock before the hook runs.** The existing escape-key unwinds
  (`dockDragCancel`, `dragReorderCancel`) call `MouseUnlock` themselves.
  Clearing first makes that a no-op instead of a race.
- **Runs the hook at most once.** The guard makes a second cancel inert, so a
  duplicate capture-loss report cannot double-unwind.

`Cancel` takes `*Window`, not `EventCtx`, unlike the other three callbacks.
There is no event to carry, and every other lock callback reads `ctx.Event` —
handing them a nil one is a footgun rather than consistency.

## Backend contract

A backend calls `MouseCancel` when the platform ends a drag without a release.
On Win32 that is `WM_CAPTURECHANGED`, with one wrinkle: our own `ReleaseCapture`
raises it too, so an unguarded handler cancels after every normal mouse-up.
`platformState.capturing` tracks ownership and is cleared _before_
`ReleaseCapture` — that call reenters the wndproc synchronously, so a flag
cleared afterwards still reads as an involuntary loss.

## Wired hooks

| Site                         | Cancel does                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| text / RTF / input selection | remove the edge-scroll animation, which nothing else stops once the lock is gone |
| slider                       | clear the pressed flag, the value keeps what the last move set                   |
| color picker (SV area)       | restore the cursor the drag hid                                                  |
| datagrid column resize       | clear the active flag, the column keeps its dragged width, focus is not moved    |
| dock drag                    | `dockDragCancel` — drop nothing, hide the zone overlay                           |
| drag-reorder                 | `dragReorderCancel` — hide ghost and gap, leave the order alone                  |

Scrollbar, splitter and markdown selection are deliberately hookless: the
default unlock is their whole teardown.
