# Headless software rendering

Issue #333 (phase 1), issue #360 (phase 2). Status: complete.

## Problem

go-gui had no way to produce a pixel image of a frame without a GPU and a
window. Every backend under `gui/backend/` is GPU-backed or native, so there was
no way to take a screenshot in CI, no way to write a pixel-level regression
test, and no starting point for a software backend.

## Approach

The render pipeline already terminates in a flat `[]gui.RenderCmd`, and
`gui/print_pdf.go` already proves that stream replays outside a backend. The
software rasterizer is a third consumer of the same input, not a pipeline
change: no existing backend is touched and none consults it.

Two findings shaped the design.

**go-glyph is pure Go.** It shapes and rasterizes through `go-text/typesetting`
with no `import "C"`, so text works on CPU.

**`glyph.DrawBackend` is a six-method interface.** Implementing it over a CPU
framebuffer (`gui/backend/soft/glyph_backend.go`) yields every text render kind
— `RenderText`, `RenderLayout`, `RenderLayoutTransformed`, `RenderRTF`,
`RenderTextPath`, text gradients — from the same `glyph.TextSystem` the GPU
backends drive. It also supplies a real `gui.TextMeasurer` as a side effect.
This removes the issue's stated obstacle: headless frames are measured with true
font metrics, not the approximate extents a nil measurer falls back to.

## Placement

The package is `gui/backend/soft`, not package `gui` as the issue proposed.
`gui/svg` imports `gui`, so a rasterizer inside `gui` can never call
`SetSvgParser` and every SVG renders blank. A subpackage has everything it
needs: the `Render*` constants are exported (only the `renderKind` type is not),
`RenderCmd`'s fields are exported, and the one unexported payload — `textPath` —
is reachable through `gui.ComputeTextPathPlacements`. `gui/backend/gl` is the
existence proof.

## API

```go
func RenderToImage(w *gui.Window, scale float32) (*image.RGBA, error)
func RenderToPNG(w *gui.Window, scale float32, path string) error
func Release(w *gui.Window)
```

`scale` is the device pixel ratio. `scale <= 0` means 1. A window that has not
rendered yet has its `WindowCfg.OnInit` run first, as a backend does, so the
same window value passed to `backend.Run` can be passed here instead.

Preparation is idempotent and keeps the warm glyph atlas, so driving state
between captures — `TestClick`, `SetFocus`, render again — costs only the frame.
`Release` frees the text system for callers that render many windows in one
process.

## How a frame is rendered

1. Prepare: build a `glyph.TextSystem` over the software draw backend, register
   the bundled icon font and `gui.AppFontPaths` / `AppFontData`, install it as
   the window's `gui.TextMeasurer`, and install `svg.New()` as the SVG parser.
2. `w.BackingScale = scale` — read during layout by `text_optical.go` and
   `text_ink.go`, so it must be set before the frame, not only used by the
   blitter.
3. `w.SetHeadlessRender(true)`, then `w.TestRender(nil)` to settle one frame,
   then `w.Renderers()` for the command stream.
4. Replay the stream twice (below), then hand back the buffer as an
   `*image.RGBA`. The buffer is premultiplied, which is what `image.RGBA` is, so
   the PNG boundary is zero-copy.

### Why the stream is replayed twice

go-glyph rasterizes a glyph into a staging buffer when it is first drawn but
only hands the page to the backend at `Commit`. On screen the next frame
corrects the sampling. A one-shot capture has no next frame. The first pass
therefore draws the text kinds with a nil target — shaping and rasterization
run, the quads are discarded — and `Commit` uploads the atlas. Shapes, gradients
and images are skipped on the warm pass and drawn once, for real, in the second.

### Rasterization

Everything reduces to one operation: composite a source through a coverage mask,
restricted to the clip rect. The mask comes from `golang.org/x/image/vector`,
which antialiases every edge. The source is a solid color (`image.Uniform`), a
gradient sampler, or a scaled image sampler. Two consequences worth naming:

- A stroke rect is one path, not two draws: the outer rounded rect plus the
  inner one wound backwards, which the rasterizer's signed accumulation turns
  into a hole.
- Clipping is free. The mask is allocated at the intersection of the shape's
  bounding box and the clip rect, so geometry outside it is never rasterized.
  `RenderClip` replaces the clip rather than nesting it, matching the scissor
  semantics the GPU backends and `gui/print_pdf.go` implement. A degenerate rect
  restores the full buffer.

Gradients are **not** resampled to five stops. That cap is a shader uniform
budget. A CPU sampler has none, so the full stop list is honored — the same
choice the web backend's canvas gradients make.

## Reproducibility

`(*Window).SetHeadlessRender` is window-scoped, not a process global: theme,
focus and state are all window-owned here and this belongs with them. It
suppresses visuals whose appearance depends on wall-clock time — today the
blinking caret, gated in `inputCursorOn`. The caret was already off headlessly
(no animation goroutine drives the blink atomic), so the flag turns an accident
of timing into a guarantee, and gives any later wall-clock visual one place to
consult. It is deliberately not a general "no animation" switch.

go-shirei's `ResetInputSession` has no counterpart here: go-gui's leak surface —
focus, hover, mouse position — is per-`Window`, so two captures share state only
when the caller reuses the window, which is the point of `RenderToImage` taking
one.

## Phase split

Phase 1 (issue #333) covered `RenderClip`, `RenderRect`, `RenderStrokeRect`,
`RenderCircle`, `RenderLine`, `RenderGradient`, `RenderGradientBorder`,
`RenderImage`, and every text kind.

Phase 2 (issue #360) added `RenderSvg`, `RenderShadow`, `RenderBlur`, the filter
bracket, the stencil bracket, the rotation bracket, and `RenderTermGrid`.
`RenderCustomShader` stays unsupported by design — it is GLSL, and there is no
CPU equivalent to compile.

The unsupported kinds are still listed in one explicit `case` in
`gui/backend/soft/draw.go` rather than caught by a `default`, so a newly added
render kind is a compile-visible decision. This follows the precedent in
`gui/print_pdf.go`.

## Layers: one mechanism for three brackets

Filters, stencil clipping and rotation all scope later drawing, and all three
use the same construction: `RenderFilterBegin` / `RenderStencilBegin` /
`RenderRotateBegin` re-point the render target at an offscreen layer. The
bracketed commands draw into it unaware, and the matching end composites the
layer back with the scoped effect applied. The effect is a coverage mask for the
stencil, an inverse-mapped resample for the rotation, and blur plus color matrix
plus repeated composite for the filter.

The alternative — carrying a transform and a clip mask through every draw path —
was rejected. It touches every phase 1 file and still does not cover text, which
goes through go-glyph's draw backend rather than this package's path builders.
With a layer, a rotated caption and a stencil-clipped image are correct for
free.

Three consequences worth naming:

- **Nesting needs no depth counter.** An inner bracket composites into the outer
  bracket's layer, which is already masked. `RenderCmd.StencilDepth` is what the
  GL backend uses to unwind a shared stencil buffer. A layer stack has nothing
  to unwind, so it is read only as documentation of intent.
- **Layers are full window size and pooled.** Full size keeps every coordinate
  in device space, so no draw path does offset bookkeeping. The cost is bounded
  by pooling (`renderer.layerPool`) plus a per-layer dirty box: clearing and
  compositing walk only the pixels a bracket actually wrote.
- **The clip carries across the bracket, and is not restored on pop.** That is
  what the GPU backends do — a scissor survives an FBO bind — and the render
  stream re-emits the clip it wants after `RenderStencilEnd`.

An unbalanced stream is not allowed to swallow content: `finishBrackets` closes
anything still open at the end of the pass, and an end command of the wrong kind
is ignored rather than popping a bracket it did not open.

## SVG triangles

`RenderSvg` arrives as a flat triangle list with an optional color per vertex.
Either way the coverage for a whole command comes from a **single path**, never
one triangle at a time: the rasterizer accumulates signed coverage across a
path, so the interior edges triangles share cancel exactly. Rasterized
separately, a shared edge is antialiased twice: two ~50% coverages that
composite to 75%, not 100%. The background then shows through as a lattice of
pale lines over every gradient.

Flat geometry is therefore filled as one path in one color. Vertex-colored
geometry is a mesh, and takes two passes: the same single-path coverage mask,
plus a pooled layer holding the shading, which is composited through it. The
shading is **written, not blended**, so a pixel two triangles both claim along a
shared edge is painted once — their colors agree there, and blending twice
darkens every seam of a translucent gradient. Each triangle paints every pixel
centre inside it plus a half-pixel skirt. The skirt keeps the mesh's outer edge
from thinning, where a pixel the mask includes at 40% can have its centre just
outside the triangle. Interior pixels are unaffected, since the triangles tile
and every centre inside the mesh is already claimed. Within a triangle the color
is the barycentric interpolation of its three vertices, the CPU equivalent of
the GPU's varying interpolation.

The vertex transform order mirrors `gui/backend/gl`'s `drawSvg`:
`animateTransform` scale and translate, then rotation about (`RotCX`, `RotCY`),
then the command's own `Scale` and origin. `IsClipMask` geometry is skipped, as
it is in every other backend — no render pipeline consumes it yet.

## Shadow and blur

The GPU path is one SDF quad per command. The CPU path rasterizes the same
rounded rect into a coverage mask, blurs the mask, and composites the color
through it. A shadow additionally multiplies in the complement of its caster's
coverage, which is the shader's second SDF. The blur is three box passes — the
standard Gaussian approximation, at a cost independent of the radius, which is
what makes a large shadow affordable on a CPU. `sigmaPerBlur` documents how a
command's blur radius maps onto a standard deviation, since the shaders ramp
linearly across a band rather than convolving.

## Bounds on hostile input

A CPU rasterizer turns an unvalidated number into wall-clock time, so the phase
2 kinds clamp what they accept rather than trusting the stream. Blur radii reach
`soft` from widget config and from an SVG filter's `stdDev`. `clampBlur` rejects
NaN and caps the radius at `maxBlur` device pixels, because an infinite radius
sizes the box-blur sliding window and the failure is a hang rather than a wrong
pixel. `blurPlanes` caps sigma again at the plane's own size, past which a box
already averages everything. `RenderFilterBegin.Layers` is the count of
`feMergeNode` elements in an untrusted document and each layer is a full
composite pass, so `maxFilterLayers` caps the repeat. Corner radii and extents
go through negated `>` comparisons, which reject NaN where `<= 0` passes it on
to the rasterizer as NaN control points. `maxLayerDepth` caps bracket nesting:
past it the bracketed commands draw into the parent, which keeps the begin/end
pairing intact and loses only the scoped effect.

Compositing saturates rather than wrapping. A filter's color matrix clamps each
channel independently, so it can leave a pixel whose color exceeds its own
alpha. The unclamped premultiplied sum passes 255 and wraps a bright pixel to
near-black. `overPremul` is the single place that blend is spelled.

## Not in either phase

Pixel golden images (issue #361) are a separate decision from the renderer
itself and landed as their own suite (`TestPixelGolden` in this package,
`testdata/*.png`). Platform font variance and antialiasing stability make the
goldens text-free by construction, with a tolerance-based comparison instead of
exact bytes. See `docs/specs/pixel-golden-images.md`. The tests here assert
pixel values from constructed command streams as well, which is
platform-independent.
