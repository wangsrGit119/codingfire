# Spec: per-scope uniqueness (framework-computed effective IDs)

Status: **implemented** (phases A, B and C). Written 2026-08-09. Revised after
review (round 2: generation-time scope for widget state, datagrid exception,
migration-list gaps). Implemented 2026-08-09. Source: "Remaining work" in
[`widget-id-scoping.md`](widget-id-scoping.md). Target: major version (semantic
break, signatures unchanged).

## What shipped, and where it differs from this spec

Read this section first: three decisions below were changed during
implementation, and the code is the authority.

1. **The resolve pass runs from `layoutArrange`, not from `layoutPipeline`, and
   floats are _not_ a scope boundary.** `resolveShapeIDs` walks the whole main
   tree **before** `layoutRemoveFloatingLayouts` extracts the floats, then each
   injected overlay (toast, dialog, inspector) is resolved separately as its own
   root. Consequence: a float written inside an ID-bearing panel — a combobox
   dropdown, a popover — **keeps that panel's scope**, where the "each float is
   its own pipeline root with an empty scope" rule strips it. That rule was a
   consequence of _where_ the pass ran, not a goal, and keeping the scope is
   strictly better: it removes a class of cross-panel collision, and it lets the
   generation-time scope and the pass agree with no float special case (a widget
   cannot know its shape is a float before it builds it). Injected overlays
   still start from an empty scope, so the spec's statement about tooltips and
   menus injected from outside the tree holds.
2. **`EventCtx.EffID` was added.** Decision 7 assumed a stateful widget always
   has a `*Window` while it composes. Several do not: `Input`, `Slider`,
   `ProgressBar`, `Skeleton` and `Scrollbar` build their trees in plain
   factories and capture `cfg.ID` as a leaf. Their handlers resolve at dispatch
   time instead, walking the ancestor chain for the shape that carries the leaf.
   Same `resolveLeaf`, so the two paths cannot drift. `Splitter` was one of
   these and is now converted (issue #264): it is a struct view whose
   `GenerateLayout` resolves the effective ID once (`id := w.EffID(cfg.ID)`) and
   composes every inner ID (panes, handle, collapse buttons) from that path —
   the root shape stays on the plain leaf and the framework joins it to the same
   string, while the composed children are absolute.
3. **The "still globally competing" warning is a debug category, not an
   ergonomics-audit mode.** "Has no ID-bearing ancestor" is a property of the
   composed tree, which the AST does not have. It is `gui.DebugUnscopedIDs`,
   deliberately **outside** `DebugAll` — it reports a design property, not a
   defect, and fires on most widgets in a small app. Enable it with
   `gui.DebugCategories(gui.DebugUnscopedIDs)`.
4. **A read-back seam was added** (#521). The spec made effective IDs the form
   every addressing API takes but gave an app no way to learn one: the author
   had to apply the join rule to their own View tree by hand, and a wrong
   spelling failed silently. `(*Window).ResolveID(leaf)` answers with the
   identities the last frame stamped for that leaf, and
   `(*Window).EffectiveIDs()` lists the frame. Both read the arranged tree
   rather than re-deriving the rule, so they cannot drift from it.
   `gui.DebugUnknownFocus` reports the other half — a frame that finished with a
   focus ID nothing focusable claims.

4a. **A lookup that misses is reported** (#536, 2026-09-07). `ResolveID` answers
the question, but nothing made an author ask it: `FindByID`, `ScrollVerticalTo`
and `ScrollVerticalToPct` all take the effective ID and all answer a
leaf-spelled argument by doing nothing, into the caller's usual
`if !ok { return }`. `gui.DebugUnknownLookup` (in `DebugAll`) reports the miss
and names the spelling the frame did stamp. Two properties keep it honest: it
fires **only on a near miss** — an identity in the frame whose last segment is
the leaf asked for — so probing for a widget that may be absent
(`rtfResolveAnchor`) and setting a scroll offset before the first frame stay
silent; and its warn-once memory is **package-level**, because `FindByID` is a
`Layout` method and a `Layout` does not name the window that stamped it. That
last point is why this category is asserted through the debug output rather than
through `(*Window).TestFindings`.

5. **Generation owns the stamp** (#527, 2026-09-06). The spec put the join in a
   pass over the built tree, and `appendChildViews` computed the same string a
   second time to give a widget its scope while generating. Two implementations
   of one rule drifted, and #518, #519 and #520 are what that looked like from
   outside. Identity is now stamped **once, during generation**, where the scope
   is known: `stampEffID` is the only writer of `effID`, called from
   `generateViewLayout` for whatever a view returned and from `appendChildViews`
   for a parent on its way to pushing that parent's scope. Nothing recomputes an
   identity afterwards. Points 1 and 2 above are unaffected in behaviour and
   both now hold by construction rather than by agreement between two passes;
   the float rule in particular is no longer a consequence of pass ordering,
   because a float is stamped where it was written and extraction cannot move
   it.

   What is left of the pass is `resolveFocusOwners`, which rewrites a
   `Shape.focusOwner` reference. That one names an ancestor by its **leaf**, so
   resolving it needs the ancestor stack a walk has and a downward scope string
   does not. It joins nothing on the common path — the scope it carries is read
   back off the stamps — and `BenchmarkLayoutArrange` measured −2%.

   The single implementation is kept honest by `gui.DebugStampDrift`, in
   `DebugAll`, which runs from that same walk (the last pass that sees a shape
   next to its scope; by frame-audit time the floats have been lifted into their
   own layers) and reports a shape whose stamp disagrees with the scope it was
   arranged under, or an ID-bearing shape with no stamp at all — the signature
   of a hand-built `Layout` appended to a generated tree.

   `(*Window).EffID` is unchanged and still necessary: a widget that reads its
   own state inside `GenerateLayout` cannot wait for its own shape to be
   stamped. It joins the same ambient scope through the same `resolveLeaf`. The
   eager-factory failure is also unchanged — a factory body runs before the
   descent that opens its scope, so there is nothing to stamp yet, and
   `DebugUnresolvedKeys` still reports it (see point 6).

6. **The last two eager factories are gone** (#528, 2026-09-06). `WithTooltip`
   and `Menubar` were the remainder of the class #518, #519 and #520 addressed,
   found by auditing every `w.EffID` call site against its enclosing function.
   `WithTooltip` resolved in the factory body, which runs while the parent's
   `Content` slice is built, so the tip ID joined the enclosing scope while the
   popup's shape landed under the panel — two tooltips with the same text in two
   panels shared one hover entry. `Menubar` resolved nowhere at all: every key
   was the bare leaf while the `Row` it returns carried an ID that generation
   joined. Both now defer behind `viewFunc` and resolve inside the deferred
   build, which is the remedy this spec already prescribes and the one
   `ContextMenu` and `Table` use. Every remaining `EffID` call site in `gui/`
   either sits in a `GenerateLayout` method or in a helper that is itself
   deferred.

7. **`EventCtx.EffID` keeps its argument** (#526, 2026-09-06). #518 left a
   second option open: stamp the resolved ID on the shape and give handlers a
   `ctx.Key()` that reads it, retiring `ctx.EffID(leaf)` "for the common case
   where the leaf names the handler's own shape". That case does not exist. All
   ten non-test call sites resolve a leaf naming a shape **at or above** the
   handler — a scrollbar resolves the scrollable ancestor it drives, and
   `inputOnClick` sits on an ID-less inner row and resolves the outer
   container's leaf — so `ctx.Key()` would have replaced none of them and would
   have become a second seam beside the one it was meant to retire. A rename was
   rejected too: the seam is `exportaudit:keep`, so it costs either a break for
   third-party widget code or a deprecated alias, and a name like
   `ResolveAncestorID` would misdescribe the fallback branch, which joins the
   nearest scope for a leaf that names no ancestor at all. The trap the option
   was meant to close is now covered by `DebugUnresolvedKeys` (#520) and
   `DebugUnknownFocus` (#521), which report the bare-leaf key and the unclaimed
   focus ID respectively. The doc comment on `EffID` states the contract
   instead.

Phase A.4 (producer simplification) was applied where a composite's own nesting
already mirrors `ScopeID(cfg.ID, part)` — combobox and select now set a plain
`"dropdown"` leaf. Composites whose inner IDs are reverse-parsed or whose owner
is not an ancestor keep absolute IDs, and the remaining stateful widgets resolve
`cfg.ID` once (`cfg.ID = w.EffID(cfg.ID)`) so their composed children are
absolute strings equal to their own effective paths. Datagrid is untouched, as
decided below.

**Phase C is done, and the benchmark decided it.** (Re-measured on #527, after
generation took over the stamp: removing the memo still costs +25% allocs/op, so
the cache stays.) Without a cache the join cost one allocation per ID-bearing
widget per frame, measured on `BenchmarkViewFrame` as 202 → 252 allocs/op
(rows_50) and 802 → 1002 (rows_200) — exactly +1 per row. `(*Window).joinLeaf`
memoizes `(scope, leaf) → joined` in a bounded map shared by both paths, which
puts every one of those numbers back on its baseline.
`TestJoinLeafCachedIsAllocationFree` gates it. A hit is always correct and an
eviction only recomputes, because the key is identity, not position — the
objection to a positional cache never applied here.

One cost remains and cannot be cached away: `effID` moved `Shape` from 280 to
296 bytes, across a size-class boundary (288 → 320), so every shape allocates 32
bytes more. On an 11k-shape frame that is ~355 KB of extra transient garbage.
`focusOwner` is resolved **in place** rather than in a second field to avoid
paying that again — a second string leaves only 8 bytes of headroom before the
next size class.

One behavioral detail worth recording: `a11yLabel` now announces only the last
segment when it falls back to an ID. The fallback is a widget ID, IDs are now
paths, and a screen reader must hear `name`, not `settings:name`. An explicit
`A11YLabel` is never touched.

This document is the normative spec for the change. Implementation phases follow
the decisions below. Parent doc [`widget-id-scoping.md`](widget-id-scoping.md)
keeps the `:` grammar, `ScopeID` / `ScopeIDN`, and no-escaping rules.

## Problem

Nothing crashes. The remaining limit is **composability**.

Today every `Shape.ID` is a **window-global** key for focus, scroll, hover,
hero, and per-widget state. Two shapes with the same ID in one frame share one
slot. `TestDuplicateIDs` and the debug audit report that. They do not make reuse
safe.

This is illegal (or fragile) even when the widgets sit in different panels:

```go
Panel{ID: "settings", Content: Input{ID: "name", ...}}
Panel{ID: "profile",  Content: Input{ID: "name", ...}}
```

Both claim `"name"`. Authors must hand-namespace every nested control
(`ScopeID("settings", "name")`, …). In a large app, every leaf ID is a global
name.

The showcase reuses `"input-text"` across demos only because those demos do not
appear in the same frame. That is mutual exclusion, not scoping. Reuse under two
ID-bearing panels becomes safe only after this change, and only if those panels
actually carry IDs.

[`widget-id-scoping.md`](widget-id-scoping.md) already fixed the other half: one
separator, `ScopeID`, and framework self-collisions (`focusOwner`, markdown
ownership). **Per-scope uniqueness** is the leftover: can two panels each use
`"name"` if the framework joins ancestor IDs into an effective key?

## Why raw IDs and tree position both fail

Per-container uniqueness is only meaningful if the **framework** computes
identity:

| Approach                             | Result                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Key stores on raw `Shape.ID`         | No-op. Both panels still store under `"name"`.                                                             |
| Scope by tree position / child index | Silent identity migration on reorder — the failure Decision 1 in the parent spec rejects for implicit IDs. |

## Invariant

**Effective identity** (`effID`) is window-unique. **Leaf** `Shape.ID` can
repeat across scopes.

```
effID(shape) =
  shape.ID                           if shape.ID contains ":"   // absolute
  ScopeID(effID(nearest ID-bearing ancestor), shape.ID)
                                     if shape.ID != "" and an ID-bearing ancestor exists
  shape.ID                           if shape.ID != "" and no ID-bearing ancestor
  ""                                 if shape.ID == ""
```

Rules:

- **ID-bearing** means non-empty `Shape.ID`. Join only on those ancestors. Never
  position, never count.
- ID-less ancestors add no scope. Children under them stay flat. Collisions stay
  loud, as today.
- An absolute ancestor still contributes its full `effID` as the join prefix:
  leaf `"name"` under `"app:settings"` → `"app:settings:name"`.
- A leaf that already contains `:` is an **absolute** identity. Generation does
  not join it further. That is the compatibility path for today's `ScopeID`
  results.
- Absolute (`:`) is not an opt-out that keeps a bare global leaf under an ID'd
  ancestor. Under an ID'd ancestor, a plain leaf always becomes `ancestor:leaf`.
  There is no "stay bare `ok` under panel `p`" mode.
- **Joined vs absolute can collide:** leaf `"b"` under ID-bearing ancestor `"a"`
  yields `"a:b"`, which an absolute root leaf `"a:b"` also yields. Same stance
  as the parent spec's escaping note: it is a duplicate ID, reported loudly by
  `TestDuplicateIDs` and the debug audit, never silent.

`TestDuplicateIDs` and the debug audit key on `effID`, not on the leaf.

## Decisions

These supersede parent Decisions 1–2 for identity resolution. The `:` grammar
and no-escaping rules stay.

This is **not** a widget-side ID stack inside `GenerateLayout`. Widget factories
still set leaf `Shape.ID` (plain or absolute). Scope is the framework's job.
Identity is stamped **once, during generation** (`stampEffID`, called from
`generateViewLayout` and `appendChildViews` — point 5 above), so there is no
second pass for a widget to wait for. Widget-internal state read **during**
`GenerateLayout` cannot wait for its own shape to be stamped — Decision 7 gives
widgets their scope at generation time instead, through the same `resolveLeaf`
the stamp uses.

1. **Framework join on ID-bearing ancestors.** Containers with an ID push a
   namespace for descendants that use plain leaf IDs. Moving a widget under a
   differently-named ID'd container **changes** its `effID` (and its state
   slot). That is intentional: the app changed an explicit ancestor ID. Reorder
   under the same ancestor keeps identity stable.
2. **Public APIs take effective IDs.** `SetFocus`, `ScrollVerticalTo`,
   `FindByID`, and test helpers keep the same signatures (flat `string`). The
   string they match is `effID`, not the leaf. Call sites that pass a bare leaf
   after an ancestor gains an ID must pass the full path (or keep composing with
   `ScopeID` and rely on the absolute escape). This is a **semantic** API break
   on a major version.
3. **`Shape.ID` is the leaf. `Shape.effID` is the resolved path.** New
   unexported field. Do not rewrite `ID` in the pass — that breaks debug paths
   and mid-frame reads that still mean the leaf.
4. **No bare global leaf under an ID'd ancestor.** Answer to the opt-out
   question: the `:` absolute form is sufficient. A separate opt-out is not.
5. **Hero stays identity-keyed.** Same leaf under different ancestor IDs does
   **not** hero-match across a transition. Apps that need a shared hero key must
   use the same absolute (`:`-bearing) ID on both sides, or share an ID-bearing
   ancestor path.
6. **`focusOwner` / `focusKey` resolve to `effID`.** Today `focusOwner` is a
   string copy of the owner's leaf ID. `focusKey()` returns that string or
   `s.ID`. After stores key on `effID`, that leaf string is wrong under a scoped
   ancestor (`"name"` vs `"settings:name"`). The resolve pass (or `focusKey`)
   must return the **owner's `effID`**. Preferred: stamp an unexported owner
   effective key during resolve (or turn `focusOwner` into a `*Shape` and read
   `owner.effID`). Do not leave `focusKey` returning a bare leaf while focus /
   input-state / spell-check maps hold `effID`.
7. **Generation-time scope for widget-state keys.** Widgets that read `StateMap`
   inside `GenerateLayout` (combobox open/query/highlight/items, theme-picker
   select, tree / sidebar / listbox state, …) cannot wait for their own shape to
   be stamped — their tree shape depends on the read. `appendChildViews`
   maintains a framework-side scope: on its way to pushing a parent's scope it
   stamps the parent, so `w.EffID(leaf)` joins the current scope with the leaf
   (absolute `:` leaves pass through unchanged). Stateful widgets key every
   `ns*` map on `w.EffID(cfg.ID)`, reads and writes alike (event handlers close
   the key over at generation. It stays valid while ancestor IDs do). A float is
   not a scope boundary: it is stamped where it was written, so the
   generation-time scope and the stamp agree with no float special case. One
   `resolveLeaf(scope, leaf)` helper implements both paths so they cannot drift.
   Cost: one `:`-join per stateful widget per frame — Phase C's memo is shared
   with this path.

## Worked examples

| Tree                                                      | Leaf IDs           | `effID`s                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Panel{ID:"settings"}` → `Input{ID:"name"}`               | `settings`, `name` | `settings`, `settings:name`                      |
| Two such panels (`settings` / `profile`)                  | same leaves        | `settings:name` vs `profile:name` — no collision |
| ID-less `Column` → two `Input{ID:"name"}`                 | `name`, `name`     | both `name` — loud collision, as today           |
| `Input{ID: ScopeID("grid","row","1")}` under any ancestor | `grid:row:1`       | `grid:row:1` (absolute, no further join)         |

### Producer simplification is load-bearing

Absolute children skip the join. Nested `ScopeID(cfg.ID, part)` therefore stays
window-global even when the owner shape sits under an ID'd panel:

```go
// Two pickers, same cfg.ID, under different panels — owners are fine,
// absolute scroll children collide:
Panel{ID: "settings", Content: ColorPicker{ID: "palette"}} // owner → settings:palette
Panel{ID: "profile",  Content: ColorPicker{ID: "palette"}} // owner → profile:palette
// each still emits ScopeID("palette", "scroll") → "palette:scroll" (absolute)
```

A composite whose own container nesting already mirrors `ScopeID(owner, part)`
**must** drop that `ScopeID` and set a plain leaf (no `:`) now that generation
stamps `effID`. Until those producers simplify, reuse under ID'd ancestors is
**not** safe for that widget — `TestDuplicateIDs` will still report the absolute
children. Leave absolute only when the leaf needs `:` (`ScopeIDN`) or the owner
is not an ancestor ID (synthetic prefixes, toast, command-button scopes).

```go
// App content under ID'd panels — the composability win
Panel{ID: "settings", Content: Input{ID: "name"}}  // effID → settings:name
Panel{ID: "profile",  Content: Input{ID: "name"}}  // effID → profile:name

// Framework composite — scroll child under a shape that already has cfg.ID
scrollID := ScopeID(cfg.ID, "scroll") // today: absolute "palette:scroll"
ID: "scroll"                          // after: leaf; effID → palette:scroll
                                      // under panel "settings" → settings:palette:scroll

// Keep absolute when the leaf needs ":" (ScopeIDN) or the owner is not an
// ancestor ID (synthetic prefixes, toast, command-button scopes):
ID: ScopeIDN(cfg.ID, "opt", i)        // "group:opt:2" — do not strip
```

`ScopeIDN("", "opt", i)` is **not** a valid simplification: it yields `"opt:2"`,
which contains `:` and therefore skips the join.

**Datagrid is the canonical cannot-simplify composite.** Its children are
absolute multi-part IDs by design: `dataGridHeaderColIDFromLayoutID` reverse-
parses a header cell ID by trimming `dataGridHeaderPrefix(gridID)` off a
`ScopeID(gridID, "header", col)` leaf (`gui/datagrid/view_data_grid_header.go`),
and row keys (`ScopeID(cfg.ID, "row", rowID)`) and the scroll child
(`dataGridScrollID`) are likewise multi-part. Absolute leaves skip the join, so
the children can never pick up the surrounding scope from the resolve pass, and
they must stay absolute because the reverse parse requires it.

**The prefix they are built from is now the grid's resolved ID** (#519).
`datagrid.New` returns a deferred view; the build resolves `cfg.ID` with
`w.EffID` once, at the top, and every state key, child ID and reverse-parse
prefix derives from that one string. So a grid with `cfg.ID` `"grid"` inside a
panel `"detail"` is `detail:grid` and its rows are `detail:grid:row:<key>`, and
two grids sharing a `cfg.ID` under different panels no longer collide. The
exception that remains is the spelling: the children are composed absolutely
rather than joined by the pass. Leaf-ID consumers take the effective form —
`FindByID`, `IsFocus`, and `datagrid.GetSourceStats`.

**Dock is the second deliberate absolute composite, for the opposite reason.** A
dock group container takes `ScopeID(dockID, node.ID)` and a dock splitter takes
`ScopeID(dockID, "split", node.ID)` (`gui/view_dock_layout.go`), so both are
absolute and skip the join. That is the point: a group's position in the dock
tree changes on every drop, and the group scopes the panel content inside it, so
a position-derived group ID re-keys every widget in the panel — its scroll
offset, its focus, its input state — whenever anything else in the dock moves
(issue #389). The dock's own ID is resolved (`w.EffID(cfg.ID)`), so the composed
ID still carries the surrounding scope. What it does not carry is the splitter
path. Node IDs minted by `dockTreeSplitAt` / `dockTreeWrapRoot` join with `-`,
not `IDSep`: a node ID is tree data fed into `ScopeID` as a **part**, and an
`IDSep` in a part makes the composed leaf absolute in the wrong way —
window-global, outside the dock scope.

## Identity stamping (was: resolution pass)

Identity is stamped during generation, not by a pass over the built tree (point
5 above): `generateViewLayout` stamps whatever a view returned and
`appendChildViews` stamps a parent on its way to pushing that parent's scope.
What is left of the pass this section originally described is
`resolveFocusOwners`, run from `layoutArrange`, which rewrites `focusOwner`
references in place. Injected overlays (toast, dialog, inspector) arrange as
their own roots with an empty scope.

**Float scope boundary:** a float is stamped where it was written, so it keeps
the scope of the ID-bearing ancestors around its write site — a combobox
dropdown or popover inside a panel carries that panel's scope, and extraction
cannot move it. Injected tooltips/menus only pick up scope from ID'd ancestors
**inside their own tree**.

The Decision 7 generation-time scope agrees by construction: a widget inside a
float reads the same keys the stamp produces. Both go through the shared
`resolveLeaf(scope, leaf)` helper.

## Migrate keying and match sites

Switch `shape.ID` → `effID` at stores and matches that run after layout, and
`cfg.ID` → `w.EffID(cfg.ID)` for widget-state keys read during `GenerateLayout`,
one commit each with a test:

- **Stores:** hover map (`gui/layout_pipeline.go`), focus `seen` map
  (`gui/layout_query.go`), focus store `w.viewState.focusID`
  (`gui/window_focus.go`), overflow map (`nsOverflow`, `gui/state_registry.go`),
  debug audit `ids` map (`gui/debug.go`), layout-transition snapshots
  (`gui/animation_layout.go`), hero snapshots/apply (`gui/animation_hero.go`),
  scroll matching / `findScrollLayout`, **StateMap** entries keyed by widget
  identity:
  - read **after** layout (input-state, spell-check, focus paint) → `effID`
  - read **during** `GenerateLayout` (combobox, theme picker, tree, sidebar,
    listbox, date picker, …) → `w.EffID(cfg.ID)` (Decision 7)
- **Matches:** `FindByID`, `FindLayoutByFocusID`, `FindLayoutByScrollID`,
  `gui/event_handlers.go`, `gui/view_slider.go`, `gui/view_tooltip.go`.
- **`reservedDialogID`:** keep comparing the **leaf** sentinel
  (`"___dialog_reserved_do_not_use___"`). Dialogs are separate float roots, so
  leaf and `effID` stay equal under empty scope. Do not fold this into the
  FindByID migration. Optionally make the constant absolute later if dialogs
  ever nest under ID'd ancestors in the same tree.
- **Also migrate** any widget code that compares `cfg.ID` or `Shape.ID` to the
  focus / scroll / hover / StateMap store (`IsFocus`, focus paint, input-state,
  spell-check). After the change those stores hold `effID`. "Already a full path
  string" is not enough once producers emit plain leaves. Fix `focusKey()` per
  Decision 6 so Input's inner text keeps working. Note the `AmendLayout`
  `IsFocus` call sites that pass the leaf today — they become `effID` (or
  `w.EffID`), read back with `shape.idKey()` rather than the bare `Shape.ID`.

## Implementation phases

### Phase A — per-scope uniqueness

1. Land this spec (done as draft).
2. Add `effID` + `resolveShapeIDs`. Call it first in every `layoutPipeline`
   (main + floats). Implement Decision 6 (`focusKey` → owner `effID`) and
   Decision 7 (generation-time scope, `w.EffID`, shared `resolveLeaf`).
3. Migrate stores/matches as above (including StateMap: post-layout keys to
   `effID`, `GenerateLayout`-time keys to `w.EffID`. Exclude `reservedDialogID`
   leaf sentinel).
4. **Required before the composability claim:** simplify every nesting-mirroring
   `ScopeID(cfg.ID, part)` producer to a plain leaf. Leave absolute leaves that
   cannot simplify. Until this lands, two instances of the same composite under
   different ID'd panels still collide on absolute children.
5. Warn on state-keyed shapes (focusable / scrollable / stateful) with a plain
   leaf and no ID-bearing ancestor (still globally competing) — landed as
   `gui.DebugUnscopedIDs`, deliberately outside `DebugAll` (point 3 above), not
   as an ergonomics-audit mode.
6. Docs: CLAUDE.md Focus section, parent Remaining work pointer, showcase
   regression. Showcase win requires ID-bearing demo/panel ancestors.

### Phase B — hero

Constraint, not a feature: join depends only on explicit IDs, so paths stay
stable across view transitions when ancestors stay the same. Key hero and layout
snapshots on `effID`. Add a test with an ID-bearing ancestor. Document that
different ancestor IDs do not match (Decision 5).

### Phase C — ID caching

The positional-cache objection dissolves: a cross-frame memo keyed by
**(ownerEffectiveID, leafID) → string** is identity-keyed. Eviction recomputes.
It never hands the wrong ID to the wrong row. The memo lives on `Window` and is
shared with Decision 7's generation-time joins — same key, same pure function,
so a miss recomputes identically.

1. Benchmark two frames (allocs/op + ns/op): (a) today's absolute datagrid path
   — Phase A adds nothing for `:` leaves. (b) A scoped-panel tree after Phase
   A.4, where joins run inside `resolveShapeIDs`. (c) A stateful-widget tree
   (combobox-style), where Decision 7 joins run during `GenerateLayout`. Closing
   "no cache" on (a) alone is wrong once (b) and (c) exist.
2. If (b) or (c) shows: bounded (LRU) memo in the resolve pass **and** the
   generation-time join path, alloc-gate test, invalidation note here.
3. If not: record "no cache" here and close the item.

## Closed questions

1. **Version:** major. Semantic break for callers that pass leaf IDs into public
   APIs once ancestors are ID'd.
2. **`effID` field:** new unexported field. Do not rewrite `ID`.
3. **Opt-out:** no separate opt-out. `:` means absolute. A plain leaf under an
   ID'd ancestor always joins.
4. **`focusOwner`:** resolve to owner's `effID` (Decision 6). Preferred stamp
   during resolve or `*Shape` reference. Bare leaf `focusKey` is invalid after
   stores migrate.
5. **Widget-state keys read during `GenerateLayout`:** migrate to
   `w.EffID(cfg.ID)` (Decision 7) — the widget's own shape is not stamped yet at
   that point, so only the ambient scope answers.
6. **Datagrid:** stays a permanent absolute-leaf exception in spelling only. Its
   root resolves like any other widget and every child ID is built from that
   resolved prefix (#519), so two grids sharing a `cfg.ID` under different
   scopes are distinct. What stays absolute is how the children are composed,
   because `dataGridHeaderColIDFromLayoutID` trims the prefix back off.
7. **Joined vs absolute collision** (`"a:b"` from two spellings): allowed,
   reported loudly by the duplicate-ID check. No escaping, per parent spec.
