# Pixel-level golden images for the software renderer

Issue #361. Status: complete.

## Problem

`gui/golden_test.go` diffs the serialized `[]RenderCmd` stream, which catches
command-level regressions — a wrong color, a missing draw, a moved rect. It
cannot see what only exists after the command stream is rasterized: blend order,
antialiasing, rounded-corner geometry, shadow and blur shapes. Those are exactly
the bugs a CPU rasterizer introduces, so `gui/backend/soft` needed its own
pixel-level gate. `TestPixelGolden` renders text-free views through the real
pipeline via `RenderToImage` and compares the buffer against committed PNGs in
`gui/backend/soft/testdata/`.

## The stability problem, and the text-free gate

Pixel goldens are only useful if the same input produces the same bytes on every
machine that runs the suite. Three drift sources were identified. The harness
eliminates all three at once by construction:

1. **Host font catalog.** The repo bundles no text font, so a family resolves
   through the platform catalog and different machines shape different glyphs.
2. **go-glyph working copy.** The repo's go.work points at a local go-glyph
   checkout. A developer's working copy can shape differently from the version
   CI resolves. A recording made on one can never match on the other.
3. **Arch-dependent antialiasing.** `x/image/vector` and `x/image/draw`
   accumulate coverage with SIMD, which can differ by a bit or two across GOARCH
   (recordings happen on macOS arm64. CI runs amd64 Linux and Windows).

Sources 1 and 2 are text-shaped, so **every golden case must be text-free** and
the harness enforces it: the command stream is checked for any text render kind
(`RenderText`, `RenderLayout`, `RenderRTF`, `RenderLayoutTransformed`,
`RenderTextPath`, `RenderTermGrid`) or `RenderCustomShader` and the case fails
if one appears. Icons are text kinds, so a case cannot cheat with an icon glyph.
No text kinds means go-glyph never runs and sources 1 and 2 do not exist. Source
3 is absorbed by the tolerance below. A text golden is deferred: it needs a
bundled test font (a repo-size decision) and re-records on every go-glyph bump.
The direct pixel assertions in `draw_test.go` / `draw_phase2_test.go` cover text
paths platform-independently.

## Comparison and tolerance

Two numbers, calibrated for the ±1-bit SIMD coverage noise, deliberately looser
than exact bytes:

- `pixelTol = 3` — per-channel (R, G, B, A) delta before a pixel counts as
  differing. A flat-fill color change — the common styling regression — moves
  every pixel of the shape by well over 3 and is caught.
- `maxDiffFraction = 0.5%` — the share of pixels allowed to differ. A 320x240
  frame has a few hundred antialiasing edge pixels. 0.5% (384 px) sits far above
  that and far below a moved or resized shape.

The trade is the issue's own: a small real regression inside the tolerance is
missed. The tolerance is a first guess pending the first cross-arch CI run. If
the suite reds on a runner, the failure stats show the _actual_ spread, and the
constants are widened from evidence, never blindly.

## Recording flow

```sh
go test ./gui/backend/soft/ -run TestPixelGolden -update
```

`-update` re-encodes every reference from the current renderer output, matching
the command-golden convention (`go test ./gui/ -run TestGolden -update`).
References are committed. A deliberate rendering change re-records after
reviewing the diff. An accidental one reds the suite.

## Failure artifacts

On mismatch the test writes `actual.png`, `expected.png` and `diff.png`
(differing pixels in magenta) under `gui/backend/soft/testdata/failures/` and
reports the differing-pixel count, fraction and max channel delta. The directory
is gitignored. CI uploads it as an artifact when the test job fails, so a red
pixel test is reviewable rather than a log line.

## Case set

Each case is a text-free view built around one claim the command goldens cannot
see (see `golden_cases_test.go`): rounded corners and borders (antialiased
masks), half-alpha compositing (`ColorSwatch`), linear and radial gradients,
gradient borders, circles, drop shadows, SDF blur, the color-filter bracket,
quarter-turn rotation, inline SVG (tessellation + gradient mesh), scaled memory
images, progress fills, and the focus ring. Every case records in `ThemeDark`
and `ThemeLight`. The window carries no `BgColor`, so the theme's background is
part of what is pinned.

The stencil bracket (`ContainerCfg.clipContents`) has no public trigger — the
field is unexported — so it stays covered by `draw_phase2_test.go`'s direct
pixel assertions.
