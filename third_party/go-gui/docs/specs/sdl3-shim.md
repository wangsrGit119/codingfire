[cataggar/go-gui#1](https://github.com/cataggar/go-gui/pull/1)

Status: **Closed 2026-08-12 by decision: not pursued — the SDL2 backend is
retired, so there is nothing left to shim.** See § Decision for the rationale
and the conditions that can reopen it.

## Summary

Two coordinated PRs that let go-gui (and go-glyph) target SDL3 with zero source
changes, via a cgo drop-in replacement for the `go-sdl2` API surface go-gui
uses. The shim lives in a fork of SDL's zig-build port and is consumed with a
single `go.mod` replace directive.

## Architecture

```
go-gui backend code (unchanged)
  → github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl  (import path)
    → replace → ../SDL/go-sdl2-sdl3  (go.mod)
      → cgo → SDL3 C API (zig-built, dynamic or static)
```

Three layers in the shim:

1. **`go-sdl2-sdl3/sdl`** — Hand-written cgo shim. Reshapes SDL3's split
   window-event model and float coordinates back into the SDL2-style API. Event
   conversion folds SDL3's distinct window event types into SDL2-style
   `WindowEvent` subtypes. A `cbits.c`/`cbits.h` C layer avoids cgo struct-field
   mangling by exposing field accessor functions. ~382 SDL2 API calls across
   `gui/backend/sdl2/`, `gui/backend/gl/`, and `sdlkey` compile unchanged.

2. **`go-sdl2-sdl3/mix`** — SDL_mixer-compatible audio engine on SDL3's native
   audio API (SDL3 does not bundle SDL_mixer). Per-channel `SDL_AudioStream`s
   auto-mixed by SDL + dedicated music stream. Looping/fades via get-callback,
   volume via per-stream gain. WAV decoded natively. MP3/OGG via vendored dr_mp3
   / stb_vorbis (public domain).

3. **`gosdl3/`** — Experimental. Zig comptime bindgen emits full cgo SDL3 Go
   bindings. Separate from the hand-written shim. Useful as a generated
   reference surface.

## Benefits

- **Zero go-gui code changes.** The API shim absorbs all SDL2→SDL3 differences.
- **Eliminates MSYS2/MinGW on Windows.** `zig build` + `zig cc` replaces the
  entire SDL2 toolchain. Relevant given recent CI churn pinning MSYS2 to a
  stable release (v0.27.1).
- **Static linking.** `-tags sdl3static` produces a fully static binary with no
  SDL3.dll/dylib. The static link file enumerates Win32 system libs (kernel32,
  user32, gdi32, and more) that cannot be carried by a static archive.
- **Audio without SDL_mixer.** Eliminates a separate build dependency.
- **Covers go-glyph too.** go-glyph's SDL backend (3 files) works with the same
  replace directive.
- **SDL3 is the current stable.** SDL2 is maintenance-mode. Moving now is right
  timing.

## Concerns

### zig as a new toolchain dependency

Every contributor and CI pipeline needs zig installed. zig is increasingly
popular for C/C++ cross-compilation and the `build.zig` already exists in the
forked repo, but it is a non-trivial addition. On the upside, it _replaces_
MSYS2, not adds to it — net toolchain count stays flat or drops.

### Shim location

The shim currently lives in `cataggar/SDL` (a fork of a fork of SDL's zig port).
Long-term, the shim belongs in its own standalone repo (for example,
`go-gui-org/go-sdl3-shim`) with its own lifecycle, tests, and versioning. Tying
it to a personal SDL fork creates an unclear maintenance dependency.

### Partial API coverage

The shim covers only the go-sdl2 API surface go-gui actually uses. If go-gui
later needs an API not in the shim, someone has to add it. Acceptable tradeoff —
the full go-sdl2 surface is large and mostly unused — but must be acknowledged.

### Metal backend CGo dependency

**Decision: Required, scope is small (~20 lines in `backend.go`).**

The Metal backend (`gui/backend/metal/backend.go`) directly includes `<SDL.h>`
and `<SDL_metal.h>` via CGo and calls SDL2 C functions (`SDL_Metal_CreateView`,
`SDL_Metal_GetLayer`, `SDL_Metal_GetDrawableSize`, `SDL_Metal_DestroyView`).
These are raw CGo calls, not Go-level `sdl.*` calls — the shim only covers the
Go→cgo path through `go-sdl2/sdl`.

Without updating these, macOS compilation fails under the shim. The .m file
(`metal_darwin.m`) is unaffected — it receives a `void*` CAMetalLayer pointer
regardless of how it is obtained.

Changes needed in the shim's `cbits.h`/`cbits.c`:

- Expose SDL3's `SDL_GetPointerProperty(SDL_PROP_WINDOW_METAL_CAMetalLayer)` to
  replace `SDL_Metal_CreateView` + `SDL_Metal_GetLayer`.
- Expose `SDL_GetWindowSizeInPixels` to replace `SDL_Metal_GetDrawableSize`.

These are SDL3-native APIs with no SDL2 equivalent — they belong in the shim's C
layer, not in go-gui. The callers in `backend.go` then switch from
`C.SDL_Metal_*` to the shim's C accessors.

### Downstream replace directive leakage

**Decision: Acceptable for transition. File follow-up issue for module-based
solution before v1.0.**

The `replace` is fundamental to the "zero source changes" design. go-gui has
`import "github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl"` in ~100+ files. The replace redirects
that import path to the shim without editing any source. There is no way to
eliminate the replace without changing every import statement in go-gui (which
defeats the purpose).

Go modules documents `replace` directives as explicitly non-transitive. Any
downstream project importing go-gui must manually copy the replace directive
into their own `go.mod` to build against SDL3.

Short-term this is tolerable — go-gui's primary consumers are Mike's own repos
(go-glyph, go-charts, go-edit, go-kite), which can be updated in lockstep.
Third-party consumers omitting the replace continue to build against standard
go-sdl2 (SDL2) as before — the shim is opt-in.

A standalone shim repo (`go-gui-org/go-sdl3-shim`) improves the replace target
from a local filesystem path to a versioned module URL, but does not remove the
replace itself. The only path to truly eliminating it is changing go-gui's
import paths (for example, to native SDL3 bindings via the `gosdl3/`
experiment), which is a separate, larger effort.

Ship v0.28 with replace. Accept that it is the design, not a temporary wart.

### Audio format coverage

**Decision: Non-issue. Comment fix only.**

The `sound.go` doc comment lists FLAC, AIFF, and VOC as supported formats. The
actual `Init()` default format mask is `mix.INIT_OGG | mix.INIT_MP3`
(audio.go:65). FLAC requires `mix.INIT_FLAC`. AIFF/VOC require `mix.INIT_MOD`.
These are never enabled by default — the comment documents SDL_mixer's
theoretical capabilities, not go-gui's actual behavior.

The shim's WAV/MP3/OGG coverage matches the default config exactly. No code
change needed. Update the `LoadSound` doc comment to read "Supports WAV, MP3,
OGG" to reflect reality.

### Test divergence

`TestBackendRenderSmoke` reads backbuffer after `Present()`. Defined in SDL2,
undefined in SDL3 with hardware-accelerated flip-model renderers (Direct3D11).
Passes on software renderers (CI), can read empty pixels on accelerated Windows.
Production paths (blur/color-matrix filter readback to texture targets) are
unaffected.

Additional Metal-specific gap: the Metal backend sets
`CAMetalLayer.presentsWithTransaction = YES` (metal_darwin.m:763) to eliminate
content shift during live resize. SDL3's Metal integration can handle
presentsWithTransaction differently or expose its own controls via the
Properties API. A macOS Metal smoke test variant must verify live resize
behavior under SDL3 before shipping.

### go-glyph coordination

Both repos need the same replace directive. Works with sibling-directory layout
(`../SDL/go-sdl2-sdl3`) but does not compose well across independent projects. A
standalone shim repo with its own `go.mod` module path solves this.

## Build chain comparison

|               | Current                                        | Proposed                           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| C toolchain   | MSYS2/MinGW (Windows), system cc (macOS/Linux) | zig cc (all platforms)             |
| SDL           | SDL2 via pkg-config                            | SDL3 via zig build                 |
| Audio         | SDL_mixer                                      | vendored decoders + SDL3 audio API |
| Platform libs | implicit via pkg-config                        | explicit for static builds         |

## Recommendation

**Adopt the approach, repackage first.**

The architectural idea (API shim → zero go-gui changes) is excellent and the
engineering is solid. Before merging into go-gui:

1. Extract `go-sdl2-sdl3/` into a standalone repo with its own module path,
   build instructions, and test suite.
2. Add SDL3 Metal property accessors (`SDL_GetPointerProperty`,
   `SDL_GetWindowSizeInPixels`) to the shim's `cbits.h`/`cbits.c`. Update
   `backend.go` to use them instead of `SDL_Metal_*` CGo calls.
3. Document `zig` as a build dependency in README and CI.
4. Apply the same replace directive to go-glyph.
5. Acknowledge `TestBackendRenderSmoke` caveat in backend test docs. Add macOS
   Metal-specific smoke test for live-resize behavior under SDL3 (verifies
   `presentsWithTransaction` equivalent).
6. Fix `LoadSound` doc comment: "Supports WAV, MP3, OGG" to match the default
   format mask.
7. Accept `replace` as a permanent part of the design. Document in README that
   downstream consumers must copy the directive to opt into SDL3.

## Decision (2026-08-12): closed, not pursued

~~**Adopt the approach, repackage first.**~~

**Decision: close the shim path. Do not reopen without a concrete trigger.**

The shim's design premise is gone, and its payoff is already delivered by other
work:

- **There is no import surface left to shim.** The shim works by replacing
  `github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl` so ~382 call sites compile unchanged. The
  SDL2 backend was retired in `a930638` (#42): `gui/backend/sdl2/` is gone and
  go.mod no longer references go-sdl2. A drop-in replacement with no original to
  replace changes nothing.
- **The toolchain elimination it promised is done without SDL.** The shim's
  headline benefit was dropping MSYS2/MinGW and the C toolchain on Linux and
  Windows. The purego `glbind` backend (cgo-free Phase 1, 2026-07-31) already
  builds the entire module `CGO_ENABLED=0` on both platforms — no zig, no SDL,
  no pkg-config.
- **It does not serve the platform that still needs cgo.** macOS, the only
  remaining CGo backend, is native Metal/AppKit with zero SDL dependency
  (`macos-native-backend.md`, implemented). The shim adds nothing there.
- **The cost stays real.** zig as a mandatory build tool for every contributor
  and CI pipeline, hosting in a personal SDL fork (`cataggar/SDL`) with no own
  lifecycle, and downstream replace-directive leakage — all paid to feed a
  backend that no longer exists.

### Conditions that can reopen it

- A platform appears where the purego `glbind` path cannot serve (for example an
  EGL-less target for which SDL3 is the natural host), and the shim is first
  repackaged as a standalone versioned module with its own tests.
- An SDL2 import surface is reintroduced into the tree.

The evaluation itself stands as valid groundwork: if either trigger fires, the
architecture and the repackaging plan in § Recommendation are still the right
starting point.
