# Style guide — the when, not the what

Issue #335, steps 3–4. This document is the **when**: which named role a widget
must read, and when a deviation is allowed. It cites roles, never values. Values
live in exactly one place — `ThemeMaker` and the `default*Style` mirrors. If one
is re-spelled here, it becomes the second source of truth the audit's other
findings were measured against. If this guide says "secondary text" it means
`Theme.TextStyleSecondary`, whatever it resolves to in the installed theme.

The gate that enforces these decisions is `ergonomics-audit -mode visual`
(`make ergonomics-audit`). A literal dimming alpha or type-size step in
`gui/view_*.go` fails it unless the line carries the marker (§ Deviating).

## Text — pick the role by what the text _does_

Four roles cover every de-emphasis. Choose by the text's job, not by how quiet
it looks:

| Role                   | Use when the text…                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TextStyleSecondary`   | supports primary text beside it: a hint, a detail, a measurement          |
| `TextStyleLabel`       | names a nearby value (a field's label); the one role that also steps size |
| `TextStyleDisabled`    | sits in a control the user cannot act on                                  |
| `TextStylePlaceholder` | stands in for a value not yet entered                                     |

Read the role's style directly where the text color is the theme's
(`ts := guiTheme.TextStyleSecondary`). Use `withRoleAlpha(base, role)` where the
hue is caller-supplied. The channel label on a user-picked color keeps its hue
and takes only the role's amount of quiet.

Never spell an alpha. An opaque color (`alpha 255`) is not de-emphasis and does
not need a role. A fade, a ramp, or a fill is not text and is covered by the
marker (§ Deviating), not by a role.

## Type steps — size by named handle, or not at all

The size ladder is a set of named handles (`N1`..`N6`, `M1`..`M6`, `I1`..`I6`,
`BI1`..`BI6`, `B1`..`B6`, `Icon1`..`Icon6`). Every rung is exported — an app's
widget spells the step of the widget beside it instead of guessing. Take a step
by reading the handle, never by arithmetic on `X.Size`. A `Size ± N` that
produces a text style is a finding. Two tracked exceptions carry the marker (§
Deviating).

Naming a step's _floor_ does not resolve the step. `f32Max(X.Size-4, N6.Size)`
still sizes text by arithmetic. The named rung only bounds the result. The gate
reports it either way — it keys on the arithmetic, not on how the bound is
spelled.

The mono ladder sits +1 above the roman ladder at every rung (`M4` is 13 where
`N4` is 12). This is an optical compensation for the mono face, uniform because
it is the same face at every size. Expect the step when mixing `M`-rungs with
`N`-rungs.

The ladder is derived, not stated: each theme states a **body size** and the six
rungs come from it (`textSizes`, visual-refresh §2.1). The dark/light body
is 14. The rungs are 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 22. The platform themes carry their
platform's native body — macOS 13, Windows 12, GNOME 15 — which is what they
exist for. A custom theme states `TextStyleDef.Size` and gets a complete ladder.

**Headings take B rungs.** A widget that renders a heading, a group-box title, a
dialog title, a tab label, or a table header names a bold step. Body and value
text stays N (visual-refresh §2.2):

| Widget                           | Role               | Rung               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Dialog                           | title              | `B2`               |
| Toast                            | title              | `B3`               |
| Group-box (`ContainerCfg.Title`) | title              | `B3`               |
| TabControl                       | selected tab label | `B3`               |
| TabControl                       | resting tab labels | `N3`               |
| Table / DataGrid                 | header             | bold (theme-owned) |

Recorded as **staying N**: list and tree subheadings (their hierarchy comes from
size and color, not weight), breadcrumbs, menu items, field labels, button
labels, the progress readout.

The only automatic step in the toolkit is a field label. `TextStyleLabel` steps
its own size, so a labeled form reads correctly without the widget spelling a
number.

Distinguish a type step from geometry. A row height, icon width or splitter
dimension derived from a text size (`style.Size + 4` as a width) is measurement,
not typography, and is not a finding.

## Field labels — two placements, one per control kind

- `labelledField` — the label **above** the control: form fields (`Input`,
  `Select`, `Combobox`, `NumericInput`, `DatePicker`, `InputDate`,
  `ColorPicker`). It exists so the placement and the gap are decided once, not
  per widget.
- `trailingLabel` — the label **beside** the control: boolean controls
  (`Switch`, `Toggle`, `Radio`).

The accessible name is separate: `A11YLabel`/`A11YDescription` feed the
accessibility tree. A visual label and an accessible name are both expected, and
neither substitutes for the other.

## Spacing and insets — the tiers mean relatedness

`SpacingTight` is the gap inside one composite control, between parts that read
as a single unit (calendar cells, the tab strip, submenu items). `SpacingSmall`
binds a tightly related pair (a control and its readout). `SpacingMedium`
separates members of one group. `SpacingLarge` separates sections. Prefer a tier
over a magic number. A number that bypasses the ladder is a finding on the same
basis as a dimming alpha. A structural indent (a nested blockquote, a list
depth) is not a gap between siblings and stays off the ladder. A comment must
say so.

A form control's text inset is `Theme.PaddingField` — that is what makes
controls in one row share a height. A structural wrapper (a container that
groups children but is not a box) must set `SizeBorder: NoBorder` and
`Padding: NoPadding`, so its reserved border and padding do not silently add
height.

## Radius and elevation — one ladder, two elevation tiers

The radius ladder is `Theme.RadiusSmall` 4 (badges, scrollbar thumbs),
`Theme.RadiusMedium` 6 (controls), `Theme.RadiusLarge` 12 (dialogs, dropdowns,
popovers, the tab body). One number sets it in the base theme. A platform theme
overrides it only where the platform actually differs (Windows keeps its native
large at 8). A floating surface is a style at `RadiusLarge` or higher. A control
taking `RadiusLarge` is a finding on the same basis as a magic alpha. The toggle
pill (`radiusLarge * 2`, clamped to a capsule) is the deliberate exception.
Rounding is never spelled at a call site.

Elevation has exactly two tiers (visual-refresh § 5.3): `ShadowPopover` (menus,
dropdowns, tooltips, toasts) and `ShadowDialog` (dialogs, the command palette),
both resolved in `ThemeMaker` from `ThemeCfg`. **Elevation goes on floating
surfaces only.** A panel or card that separates from its neighbors by fill value
never gets a shadow. A shadow there solves a contrast problem with the wrong
tool. `Theme.RadiusLarge` and the two shadow tiers travel together: a floating
surface carries both.

## Vertical centring — correct the ink only where the alphabet allows

A vertically-centered control centers the text's _line box_, which reserves
descent space that the ink does not always use. So short descender-free text —
digits above all — reads high. The correction is `opticalCenterText` (the
`AmendLayout` form) or `colorFieldPadding` (the padding form). Never use a local
number.

Apply it only where **the widget owns the text**. That includes a badge's count,
a progress bar's percentage, a button or tab label. Anything built on `Button`
inherits it. Apply it also where **the widget constrains the alphabet** so
nothing can descend: a color channel, a date mask, a numeric field. Text the
user types into an unconstrained control is not eligible. Correcting it drops
descender-bearing content low, and that is measured, not predicted (issue #346).

A control that **re-labels itself** — a `Select` that shows a placeholder until
an option is chosen — takes `opticalCenterLabelText`. It uses the cap band,
whatever the label says. Measuring the run there both misses the defect (a
descending label's ink band already reads low while its cap band rides high) and
steps the label when the selection changes.

A control in a **list at a regular pitch** — a menu item — takes the cap band
for a second reason. Measuring each run moves a descender-free label while
leaving its neighbor. Uneven baselines read down the whole list. The same
disagreement between two badges side by side does not.

Which form depends on what the text **is**, and the split is worth learning as
one rule:

- a **value** — a badge's count, a progress readout — is centered on its own
  ink.
- a **label** — a button, tab, menu item, select — on the face's cap band.
- a **glyph** — an icon, a step triangle, a `×` — always on its own ink, and it
  says so through its style. The theme's `Icon` rungs carry the mark, and
  `glyphStyle(ts)` applies it to a symbol drawn in a text face. A glyph child
  inside a cap-band container corrects itself, so an icon button needs nothing
  at the call site.
- **editable text** takes a content-free band, or none at all.

A digit-only label is the one case that needs saying out loud. Figures measure
shorter than caps. So a widget that knows its label is digits opts into the
figure band (`ButtonCfg.opticalDigitLabel`, as the date picker's cells do). An
application cannot — the alphabet is a guarantee only the widget that builds the
label can make.

Editable text takes the content-free form — `opticalCenterFieldText` as a hook,
`colorFieldPadding` as padding. An offset that follows the content moves the
baseline as the user types. A widget that wraps `Input` opts in with the
unexported `opticalDigitCenter`. That keeps the guarantee the caller's to make.
The probe must match the alphabet that guarantee names: the figure band for a
digit field, the cap band for a hex one. Probing the taller band for digits
overshoots by as much as leaving them alone. See
`docs/specs/text-optical-centring.md`.

## Per-state colors — ColorSet, with flat as the exception

Build per-state colors with `ColorSet` (its `resolved()` returns the
theme-matched color for the shape's state) and keep one appearance with
`Flat(c)`. Precedence: an assigned flat `Color*` field on the Cfg wins over the
`ColorSet` — the widget keeps its appearance when a set arrives.

## The accent ramp — one decision, five slots

`ThemeCfg.ColorAccent` is the single accent decision (visual-refresh § 4.3). The
other slots derive from it in `ThemeMaker` and a theme states them only to
override:

- `ColorAccentHover` — `L+0.12` in sRGB HSL (absolute, not relative — a relative
  step collapses on a dark accent).
- `ColorAccentPressed` — `L-0.12`.
- `ColorAccentSubtle` — the accent at alpha 40 (dark polarity) / 30 (light), the
  polarity detected as `textRolesFor` does it. **This is the selection wash.**
  Selected and keyboard-highlighted rows in `ListBox`, `Table`, `DataGrid`,
  `Select`, `Combobox` and the command palette paint `ColorAccentSubtle`, never
  the full accent. Focus is the ring, not a second fill. Text on a subtle row
  stays the body color. Only the full accent fill takes the paired
  `ColorTextOnAccent` foreground.
- `ColorTextOnAccent` — white when `srgbLuminance(accent) < 0.45`, black
  otherwise.

`ColorSelect` defaults to `ColorAccent`, and an unstated accent resolves to
`ColorSelect`. Selection, focus, and accent are one decision by default. They
are two when a theme needs them apart. A platform theme keeps its native accent
by stating only its own `ColorSelect`.

`ColorTextOnSelect` — the foreground over the full-accent fills (menu selection,
the selected tab, the slider fill) — defaults to the same luminance-paired
color. A light theme never draws its near-black body text on its blue accent. An
explicit `ColorTextOnSelect` still wins. The progress bar's percentage is the
exception. It straddles fill and track, so no single color pairs with both. It
keeps the body text, unboxed, and stays secondary.

The semantic colors (`ColorSuccess`, `ColorWarning`, `ColorError`) and their
`*Subtle` companions follow the same rule — fill + tint, one decision. The
presets fill all six. A validation message and its field background are meant to
be one pair (the consumers land with the validation work).

## Focus rings — the shared helper, not a local stroke

A focusable widget's focus affordance comes from the shared ring helpers
(`colorControlFocusRing`, `focusRingAmend`), which own the ring's shape and
colors. A hand-drawn focus stroke at a call site is a second implementation of
the same affordance — the divergence the audit's §6 measured.

## Button variants — one primary per surface

`ButtonPrimary` is the accent-filled call to action. The convention is **one per
surface**. A row of secondaries with a single primary says where the user lands.
Two primaries compete and say nothing. This is checked in review, not in code.
`ButtonDanger` is reserved for destructive confirmations and carries the same
one-per-surface rule. `ButtonGhost` is for actions that must not compete with
the secondaries beside them — toolbar overflow, a "cancel" that sits next to a
primary.

## Deviating

A literal dimming alpha or size step in `gui/view_*.go` is a finding unless the
line carries the deferred marker:

```go
alpha := uint8(150) // ergonomics-audit:visual
```

The marker is for the audit's documented exemptions, and they are listed here so
a new exemption is a decision, not a habit:

- **Ramps** — a graduated effect, not a state: the date-picker roller distance
  ramp (`view_date_picker_roller.go`), the math-spinner ghost and trail
  (`view_math_spinner.go`).
- **Non-text fills** — an alpha that is not de-emphasized text: markdown
  code/blockquote backgrounds, the dock zone preview, a drag ghost, a selection
  highlight, the swatch edge.
- **Tracked size steps** — two, and both for the same reason. They step from a
  caller-supplied size, which lands anywhere, so no named rung is the one to
  read. The date-picker roller's center-item emphasis
  (`view_date_picker_roller.go`) and the numeric input's step triangle
  (`view_input_numeric.go`). The ladder's rungs are non-uniform (+1 at the small
  end, +5 above medium), so no fixed step equals a rung at every size. Both
  bound the result with named rungs.

A new deviation carries the marker **and** a comment naming the reason. The gate
reports the line as deferred, so the exemption stays visible in every
`make ergonomics-audit` run. Anything else fails the gate — which is the point.
